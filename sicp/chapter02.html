We now come to the decisive step of mathematical abstraction: we
forget about what the symbols stand for. &#x2026;[The mathematician]
need not be idle; there are many operations which he may carry out
with these symbols, without ever having to look at the things they
stand for.

<p>
   We concentrated in *Note Chapter 1:: on computational processes and
on the role of procedures in program design.  We saw how to use
primitive data (numbers) and primitive operations (arithmetic
operations), how to combine procedures to form compound procedures
through composition, conditionals, and the use of parameters, and how
to abstract procedures by using `define'.  We saw that a procedure can
be regarded as a pattern for the local evolution of a process, and we
classified, reasoned about, and performed simple algorithmic analyses of
some common patterns for processes as embodied in procedures.  We also
saw that higher-order procedures enhance the power of our language by
enabling us to manipulate, and thereby to reason in terms of, general
methods of computation.  This is much of the essence of programming.
</p>

<p>
   In this chapter we are going to look at more complex data.  All the
procedures in *Note Chapter 1:: operate on simple numerical data, and
simple data are not sufficient for many of the problems we wish to
address using computation.  Programs are typically designed to model
complex phenomena, and more often than not one must construct
computational objects that have several parts in order to model
real-world phenomena that have several aspects.  Thus, whereas our
focus in *Note Chapter 1:: was on building abstractions by combining
procedures to form compound procedures, we turn in this chapter to
another key aspect of any programming language: the means it provides
for building abstractions by combining data objects to form "compound
data".
</p>

<p>
   Why do we want compound data in a programming language?  For the
same reasons that we want compound procedures: to elevate the
conceptual level at which we can design our programs, to increase the
modularity of our designs, and to enhance the expressive power of our
language.  Just as the ability to define procedures enables us to deal
with processes at a higher conceptual level than that of the primitive
operations of the language, the ability to construct compound data
objects enables us to deal with data at a higher conceptual level than
that of the primitive data objects of the language.
</p>

<p>
   Consider the task of designing a system to perform arithmetic with
rational numbers.  We could imagine an operation `add-rat' that takes
two rational numbers and produces their sum.  In terms of simple data,
a rational number can be thought of as two integers: a numerator and a
denominator.  Thus, we could design a program in which each rational
number would be represented by two integers (a numerator and a
denominator) and where `add-rat' would be implemented by two procedures
(one producing the numerator of the sum and one producing the
denominator).  But this would be awkward, because we would then need to
explicitly keep track of which numerators corresponded to which
denominators.  In a system intended to perform many operations on many
rational numbers, such bookkeeping details would clutter the programs
substantially, to say nothing of what they would do to our minds.  It
would be much better if we could "glue together" a numerator and
denominator to form a pair&#x2013;a "compound data object"&#x2013;that our programs
could manipulate in a way that would be consistent with regarding a
rational number as a single conceptual unit.
</p>

<p>
   The use of compound data also enables us to increase the modularity
of our programs.  If we can manipulate rational numbers directly as
objects in their own right, then we can separate the part of our
program that deals with rational numbers per se from the details of how
rational numbers may be represented as pairs of integers.  The general
technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how data
objects are represented from the parts of a program that deal with how
data objects are used is a powerful design methodology called "data
abstraction".  We will see how data abstraction makes programs much
easier to design, maintain, and modify.
</p>

<p>
   The use of compound data leads to a real increase in the expressive
power of our programming language.  Consider the idea of forming a
"linear combination" ax + by.  We might like to write a procedure that
would accept a, b, x, and y as arguments and return the value of ax +
by.  This presents no difficulty if the arguments are to be numbers,
because we can readily define the procedure
</p>

<p>
(define (linear-combination a b x y)
  (+ (* a x) (* b y)))
</p>

<p>
   But suppose we are not concerned only with numbers.  Suppose we
would like to express, in procedural terms, the idea that one can form
linear combinations whenever addition and multiplication are
defined&#x2013;for rational numbers, complex numbers, polynomials, or
whatever.  We could express this as a procedure of the form
</p>

<p>
(define (linear-combination a b x y)
  (add (mul a x) (mul b y)))
</p>

<p>
where `add' and `mul' are not the primitive procedures `+' and `*' but
rather more complex things that will perform the appropriate operations
for whatever kinds of data we pass in as the arguments `a', `b', `x',
and `y'. The key point is that the only thing `linear-combination'
should need to know about `a', `b', `x', and `y' is that the procedures
`add' and `mul' will perform the appropriate manipulations.  From the
perspective of the procedure `linear-combination', it is irrelevant
what `a', `b', `x', and `y' are and even more irrelevant how they might
happen to be represented in terms of more primitive data.  This same
example shows why it is important that our programming language provide
the ability to manipulate compound objects directly: Without this,
there is no way for a procedure such as `linear-combination' to pass
its arguments along to `add' and `mul' without having to know their
detailed structure.(1)
</p>

<p>
   We begin this chapter by implementing the rational-number arithmetic
system mentioned above.  This will form the background for our
discussion of compound data and data abstraction.  As with compound
procedures, the main issue to be addressed is that of abstraction as a
technique for coping with complexity, and we will see how data
abstraction enables us to erect suitable "abstraction barriers" between
different parts of a program.
</p>

<p>
   We will see that the key to forming compound data is that a
programming language should provide some kind of "glue" so that data
objects can be combined to form more complex data objects.  There are
many possible kinds of glue.  Indeed, we will discover how to form
compound data using no special "data" operations at all, only
procedures.  This will further blur the distinction between "procedure"
and "data," which was already becoming tenuous toward the end of *Note
Chapter 1::.  We will also explore some conventional techniques for
representing sequences and trees.  One key idea in dealing with
compound data is the notion of "closure"&#x2013;that the glue we use for
combining data objects should allow us to combine not only primitive
data objects, but compound data objects as well.  Another key idea is
that compound data objects can serve as "conventional interfaces" for
combining program modules in mix-and-match ways.  We illustrate some of
these ideas by presenting a simple graphics language that exploits
closure.
</p>

<p>
   We will then augment the representational power of our language by
introducing "symbolic expressions"&#x2013;data whose elementary parts can be
arbitrary symbols rather than only numbers.  We explore various
alternatives for representing sets of objects.  We will find that, just
as a given numerical function can be computed by many different
computational processes, there are many ways in which a given data
structure can be represented in terms of simpler objects, and the
choice of representation can have significant impact on the time and
space requirements of processes that manipulate the data.  We will
investigate these ideas in the context of symbolic differentiation, the
representation of sets, and the encoding of information.
</p>

<p>
   Next we will take up the problem of working with data that may be
represented differently by different parts of a program.  This leads to
the need to implement "generic operations", which must handle many
different types of data.  Maintaining modularity in the presence of
generic operations requires more powerful abstraction barriers than can
be erected with simple data abstraction alone.  In particular, we
introduce programming "data-directed programming" as a technique that
allows individual data representations to be designed in isolation and
then combined "additively" (i.e., without modification).  To illustrate
the power of this approach to system design, we close the chapter by
applying what we have learned to the implementation of a package for
performing symbolic arithmetic on polynomials, in which the
coefficients of the polynomials can be integers, rational numbers,
complex numbers, and even other polynomials.

<p>
   (1) The ability to directly manipulate procedures provides an
analogous increase in the expressive power of a programming language.
For example, in section *Note 1-3-1:: we introduced the `sum'
procedure, which takes a procedure `term' as an argument and computes
the sum of the values of `term' over some specified interval.  In order
to define `sum', it is crucial that we be able to speak of a procedure
such as `term' as an entity in its own right, without regard for how
`term' might be expressed with more primitive operations.  Indeed, if
we did not have the notion of "a procedure," it is doubtful that we
would ever even think of the possibility of defining an operation such
as `sum'.  Moreover, insofar as performing the summation is concerned,
the details of how `term' may be constructed from more primitive
operations are irrelevant.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In section *Note 1-1-8::, we noted that a procedure used as an element
in creating a more complex procedure could be regarded not only as a
collection of particular operations but also as a procedural
abstraction.  That is, the details of how the procedure was implemented
could be suppressed, and the particular procedure itself could be
replaced by any other procedure with the same overall behavior.  In
other words, we could make an abstraction that would separate the way
the procedure would be used from the details of how the procedure would
be implemented in terms of more primitive procedures.  The analogous
notion for compound data is called "data abstraction".  Data
abstraction is a methodology that enables us to isolate how a compound
data object is used from the details of how it is constructed from more
primitive data objects.
</p>

<p>
   The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that
are to use compound data objects so that they operate on "abstract
data." That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make
no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for
performing the task at hand.  At the same time, a "concrete" data
representation is defined independent of the programs that use the
data.  The interface between these two parts of our system will be a
set of procedures, called "selectors" and "constructors", that
implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete representation.  To
illustrate this technique, we will consider how to design a set of
procedures for manipulating rational numbers.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<hr />

<p>
Suppose we want to do arithmetic with rational numbers.  We want to be
able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them and to test whether
two rational numbers are equal.
</p>

<p>
   Let us begin by assuming that we already have a way of constructing
a rational number from a numerator and a denominator.  We also assume
that, given a rational number, we have a way of extracting (or
selecting) its numerator and its denominator.  Let us further assume
that the constructor and selectors are available as procedures:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`(make-rat &lt;N&gt; &lt;D&gt;)' returns therational number whose numerator is
the integer `&lt;N&gt;' and whose denominator is the integer `&lt;D&gt;'.</li>

<li>`(numer &lt;X&gt;)' returns the numerator of the rational number `&lt;X&gt;'.</li>

<li>`(denom &lt;X&gt;)' returns the denominator of the rational number `&lt;X&gt;'.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   We are using here a powerful strategy of synthesis: "wishful
thinking".  We haven't yet said how a rational number is represented,
or how the procedures `numer', `denom', and `make-rat' should be
implemented.  Even so, if we did have these three procedures, we could
then add, subtract, multiply, divide, and test equality by using the
following relations:
</p>

<p>
n<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>2</sub>   n<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> + n<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub>
&#x2014; + &#x2014; = ------------&#x2013;&#x2014;
d<sub>1</sub>   d<sub>2</sub>        d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
n<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>2</sub>   n<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> - n<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub>
&#x2014; - &#x2014; = ------------&#x2013;&#x2014;
d<sub>1</sub>   d<sub>2</sub>        d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
n<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>2</sub>   n<sub>1</sub> n<sub>2</sub>
&#x2014; * &#x2014; = --&#x2013;&#x2014;
d<sub>1</sub>   d<sub>2</sub>   d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
n<sub>1</sub> / d<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub>
----&#x2013;&#x2014; = --&#x2013;&#x2014;
n<sub>2</sub> / d<sub>2</sub>   d<sub>1</sub> n<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
n<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>2</sub>
&#x2014; = &#x2014;  if and only if n<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub>
d<sub>1</sub>   d<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
We can express these rules as procedures:
</p>

<p>
(define (add-rat x y)
  (make-rat (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
	       (* (numer y) (denom x)))
	    (* (denom x) (denom y))))
</p>

<p>
(define (sub-rat x y)
  (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
	       (* (numer y) (denom x)))
	    (* (denom x) (denom y))))
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
	    (* (denom x) (denom y))))
</p>

<p>
(define (div-rat x y)
  (make-rat (* (numer x) (denom y))
	    (* (denom x) (numer y))))
</p>

<p>
(define (equal-rat? x y)
  (= (* (numer x) (denom y))
     (* (numer y) (denom x))))
</p>

<p>
   Now we have the operations on rational numbers defined in terms of
the selector and constructor procedures `numer', `denom', and
`make-rat'.  But we haven't yet defined these.  What we need is some
way to glue together a numerator and a denominator to form a rational
number.
</p>

<p>
Pairs
&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
To enable us to implement the concrete level of our data abstraction,
our language provides a compound structure called a "pair", which can be
constructed with the primitive procedure `cons'.  This procedure takes
two arguments and returns a compound data object that contains the two
arguments as parts.  Given a pair, we can extract the parts using the
primitive procedures `car' and `cdr'.(1) Thus, we can use `cons',
`car', and `cdr' as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define x (cons 1 2))
</p>

<p>
(car x)
1
</p>

<p>
(cdr x)
2
</p>

<p>
   Notice that a pair is a data object that can be given a name and
manipulated, just like a primitive data object.  Moreover, `cons' can
be used to form pairs whose elements are pairs, and so on:
</p>

<p>
(define x (cons 1 2))
</p>

<p>
(define y (cons 3 4))
</p>

<p>
(define z (cons x y))
</p>

<p>
(car (car z))
1
</p>

<p>
(car (cdr z))
3
</p>

<p>
   In section *Note 2-2:: we will see how this ability to combine pairs
means that pairs can be used as general-purpose building blocks to
create all sorts of complex data structures.  The single compound-data
primitive "pair", implemented by the procedures `cons', `car', and
`cdr', is the only glue we need.  Data objects constructed from pairs
are called "list-structured" data.
</p>

<p>
Representing rational numbers
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Pairs offer a natural way to complete the rational-number system.
Simply represent a rational number as a pair of two integers: a
numerator and a denominator.  Then `make-rat', `numer', and `denom' are
readily implemented as follows:(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (make-rat n d) (cons n d))
</p>

<p>
(define (numer x) (car x))
</p>

<p>
(define (denom x) (cdr x))
</p>

<p>
   Also, in order to display the results of our computations, we can
print rational numbers by printing the numerator, a slash, and the
denominator:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (print-rat x)
  (newline)
  (display (numer x))
  (display "/")
  (display (denom x)))
</p>

<p>
Now we can try our rational-number procedures:
</p>

<p>
(define one-half (make-rat 1 2))
</p>

<p>
(print-rat one-half)
1/2
</p>

<p>
(define one-third (make-rat 1 3))
</p>

<p>
(print-rat (add-rat one-half one-third))
5/6
</p>

<p>
(print-rat (mul-rat one-half one-third))
1/6
</p>

<p>
(print-rat (add-rat one-third one-third))
6/9
</p>

<p>
   As the final example shows, our rational-number implementation does
not reduce rational numbers to lowest terms.  We can remedy this by
changing `make-rat'. If we have a `gcd' procedure like the one in
section *Note 1-2-5:: that produces the greatest common divisor of two
integers, we can use `gcd' to reduce the numerator and the denominator
to lowest terms before constructing the pair:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-rat n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (cons (/ n g) (/ d g))))
</p>

<p>
Now we have
</p>

<p>
(print-rat (add-rat one-third one-third))
2/3
</p>

<p>
as desired.  This modification was accomplished by changing the
constructor `make-rat' without changing any of the procedures (such as
`add-rat' and `mul-rat') that implement the actual operations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.1:</b> Define a better version of `make-rat' that handles
both positive and negative arguments.  `Make-rat' should normalize
the sign so that if the rational number is positive, both the
numerator and denominator are positive, and if the rational number
is negative, only the numerator is negative.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) The name `cons' stands for "construct."  The names `car' and
`cdr' derive from the original implementation of Lisp on the IBM 704.
That machine had an addressing scheme that allowed one to reference the
"address" and "decrement" parts of a memory location.  `Car' stands for
"Contents of Address part of Register" and `cdr' (pronounced
"could-er") stands for "Contents of Decrement part of Register."
</p>

<p>
(2) Another way to define the selectors and constructor is
</p>

<p>
(define make-rat cons)
(define numer car)
(define denom cdr)
</p>

<p>
   The first definition associates the name `make-rat' with the value
of the expression `cons', which is the primitive procedure that
constructs pairs.  Thus `make-rat' and `cons' are names for the same
primitive constructor.
</p>

<p>
   Defining selectors and constructors in this way is efficient:
Instead of `make-rat' <span class="underline">calling</span> `cons', `make-rat' <span class="underline">is</span> `cons', so
there is only one procedure called, not two, when `make-rat' is called.
On the other hand, doing this defeats debugging aids that trace
procedure calls or put breakpoints on procedure calls: You may want to
watch `make-rat' being called, but you certainly don't want to watch
every call to `cons'.
</p>

<p>
We have chosen not to use this style of definition in this book.
</p>

<p>
   (3) `Display' is the Scheme primitive for printing data.  The Scheme
primitive `newline' starts a new line for printing.  Neither of these
procedures returns a useful value, so in the uses of `print-rat' below,
we show only what `print-rat' prints, not what the interpreter prints
as the value returned by `print-rat'.

<p>
Before continuing with more examples of compound data and data
abstraction, let us consider some of the issues raised by the
rational-number example.  We defined the rational-number operations in
terms of a constructor `make-rat' and selectors `numer' and `denom'.
In general, the underlying idea of data abstraction is to identify for
each type of data object a basic set of operations in terms of which
all manipulations of data objects of that type will be expressed, and
then to use only those operations in manipulating the data.
</p>

   We can envision the structure of the rational-number system as shown
in figure *Note Figure 2-1::.  The horizontal lines represent barriers
"abstraction barriers" that isolate different "levels" of the system.
At each level, the barrier separates the programs (above) that use the
data abstraction from the programs (below) that implement the data
abstraction.  Programs that use rational numbers manipulate them solely
in terms of the procedures supplied "for public use" by the
rational-number package: `add-rat', `sub-rat', `mul-rat', `div-rat',
and `equal-rat?'. These, in turn, are implemented solely in terms of
the constructor and selectors `make-rat', `numer', and `denom', which
themselves are implemented in terms of pairs.  The details of how pairs
are implemented are irrelevant to the rest of the rational-number
package so long as pairs can be manipulated by the use of `cons',
`car', and `cdr'.  In effect, procedures at each level are the
interfaces that define the abstraction barriers and connect the
different levels.

<p>
   This simple idea has many advantages.  One advantage is that it
makes programs much easier to maintain and to modify.  Any complex data
structure can be represented in a variety of ways with the primitive
data structures provided by a programming language.  Of course, the
choice of representation influences the programs that operate on it;
thus, if the representation were to be changed at some later time, all
such programs might have to be modified accordingly.  This task could
be time-consuming and expensive in the case of large programs unless
the dependence on the representation were to be confined by design to a
very few program modules.
</p>

<p>
   For example, an alternate way to address the problem of reducing
rational numbers to lowest terms is to perform the reduction whenever
we access the parts of a rational number, rather than when we construct
it.  This leads to different constructor and selector procedures:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-rat n d)
  (cons n d))
</p>

<p>
(define (numer x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
    (/ (car x) g)))
</p>

<p>
(define (denom x)
  (let ((g (gcd (car x) (cdr x))))
    (/ (cdr x) g)))
</p>

<p>
   The difference between this implementation and the previous one lies
in when we compute the `gcd'.  If in our typical use of rational
numbers we access the numerators and denominators of the same rational
numbers many times, it would be preferable to compute the `gcd' when
the rational numbers are constructed.  If not, we may be better off
waiting until access time to compute the `gcd'.  In any case, when we
change from one representation to the other, the procedures `add-rat',
`sub-rat', and so on do not have to be modified at all.
</p>

<p>
   Constraining the dependence on the representation to a few interface
procedures helps us design programs as well as modify them, because it
allows us to maintain the flexibility to consider alternate
implementations.  To continue with our simple example, suppose we are
designing a rational-number package and we can't decide initially
whether to perform the `gcd' at construction time or at selection time.
The data-abstraction methodology gives us a way to defer that decision
without losing the ability to make progress on the rest of the system.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.2:</b> Consider the problem of representing line segments
in a plane.  Each segment is represented as a pair of points: a
starting point and an ending point.  Define a constructor
`make-segment' and selectors `start-segment' and `end-segment'
that define the representation of segments in terms of points.
Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the
x coordinate and the y coordinate.  Accordingly, specify a
constructor `make-point' and selectors `x-point' and `y-point'
that define this representation.  Finally, using your selectors
and constructors, define a procedure `midpoint-segment' that takes
a line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point
whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
endpoints).  To try your procedures, you'll need a way to print
points:
</p>

<p>
(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.3:</b> Implement a representation for rectangles in a
plane.  (Hint: You may want to make use of *Note Exercise 2-2::.)
In terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures
that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle.  Now
implement a different representation for rectangles.  Can you
design your system with suitable abstraction barriers, so that the
same perimeter and area procedures will work using either
representation?

<h3 id="orgdcef6c3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> What Is Meant by Data?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<hr />

<p>
We began the rational-number implementation in section *Note 2-1-1:: by
implementing the rational-number operations `add-rat', `sub-rat', and
so on in terms of three unspecified procedures: `make-rat', `numer',
and `denom'.  At that point, we could think of the operations as being
defined in terms of data objects&#x2013;numerators, denominators, and rational
numbers&#x2013;whose behavior was specified by the latter three procedures.
</p>

<p>
   But exactly what is meant by "data"?  It is not enough to say
"whatever is implemented by the given selectors and constructors."
Clearly, not every arbitrary set of three procedures can serve as an
appropriate basis for the rational-number implementation.  We need to
guarantee that, if we construct a rational number `x' from a pair of
integers `n' and `d', then extracting the `numer' and the `denom' of
`x' and dividing them should yield the same result as dividing `n' by
`d'.  In other words, `make-rat', `numer', and `denom' must satisfy the
condition that, for any integer `n' and any non-zero integer `d', if
`x' is (`make-rat n d'), then
</p>

<p>
(numer x)    n
----&#x2013;&#x2014; = &#x2014;
(denom x)    d
</p>

<p>
   In fact, this is the only condition `make-rat', `numer', and `denom'
must fulfill in order to form a suitable basis for a rational-number
representation.  In general, we can think of data as defined by some
collection of selectors and constructors, together with specified
conditions that these procedures must fulfill in order to be a valid
representation.(1)
</p>

<p>
   This point of view can serve to define not only "high-level" data
objects, such as rational numbers, but lower-level objects as well.
Consider the notion of a pair, which we used in order to define our
rational numbers.  We never actually said what a pair was, only that
the language supplied procedures `cons', `car', and `cdr' for operating
on pairs.  But the only thing we need to know about these three
operations is that if we glue two objects together using `cons' we can
retrieve the objects using `car' and `cdr'.  That is, the operations
satisfy the condition that, for any objects `x' and `y', if `z' is
`(cons x y)' then `(car z)' is `x' and `(cdr z)' is `y'.  Indeed, we
mentioned that these three procedures are included as primitives in our
language.  However, any triple of procedures that satisfies the above
condition can be used as the basis for implementing pairs.  This point
is illustrated strikingly by the fact that we could implement `cons',
`car', and `cdr' without using any data structures at all but only
using procedures.  Here are the definitions:
</p>

<p>
(define (cons x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((= m 0) x)
	  ((= m 1) y)
	  (else (error "Argument not 0 or 1 &#x2013; CONS" m))))
  dispatch)
</p>

<p>
(define (car z) (z 0))
</p>

<p>
(define (cdr z) (z 1))
</p>

<p>
   This use of procedures corresponds to nothing like our intuitive
notion of what data should be.  Nevertheless, all we need to do to show
that this is a valid way to represent pairs is to verify that these
procedures satisfy the condition given above.
</p>

<p>
   The subtle point to notice is that the value returned by `(cons x
y)' is a procedure&#x2013;namely the internally defined procedure `dispatch',
which takes one argument and returns either `x' or `y' depending on
whether the argument is 0 or 1.  Correspondingly, `(car z)' is defined
to apply `z' to 0.  Hence, if `z' is the procedure formed by `(cons x
y)', then `z' applied to 0 will yield `x'. Thus, we have shown that
`(car (cons x y))' yields `x', as desired.  Similarly, `(cdr (cons x
y))' applies the procedure returned by `(cons x y)' to 1, which returns
`y'.  Therefore, this procedural implementation of pairs is a valid
implementation, and if we access pairs using only `cons', `car', and
`cdr' we cannot distinguish this implementation from one that uses
"real" data structures.
</p>

<p>
   The point of exhibiting the procedural representation of pairs is
not that our language works this way (Scheme, and Lisp systems in
general, implement pairs directly, for efficiency reasons) but that it
could work this way.  The procedural representation, although obscure,
is a perfectly adequate way to represent pairs, since it fulfills the
only conditions that pairs need to fulfill.  This example also
demonstrates that the ability to manipulate procedures as objects
automatically provides the ability to represent compound data.  This
may seem a curiosity now, but procedural representations of data will
play a central role in our programming repertoire.  This style of
programming is often called "message passing", and we will be using it
as a basic tool in *Note Chapter 3:: when we address the issues of
modeling and simulation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.4:</b> Here is an alternative procedural representation
of pairs.  For this representation, verify that `(car (cons x y))'
yields `x' for any objects `x' and `y'.
</p>

<p>
(define (cons x y)
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))
</p>

<p>
(define (car z)
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))
</p>

<p>
What is the corresponding definition of `cdr'? (Hint: To verify
that this works, make use of the substitution model of section
*Note 1-1-5::.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.5:</b> Show that we can represent pairs of nonnegative
integers using only numbers and arithmetic operations if we
represent the pair a and b as the integer that is the product 2<sup>a</sup>
3<sup>b</sup>.  Give the corresponding definitions of the procedures `cons',
`car', and `cdr'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.6:</b> In case representing pairs as procedures wasn't
mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language that can
manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least
insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0
and the operation of adding 1 as
</p>

<p>
(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
</p>

<p>
(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
</p>

<p>
This representation is known as "Church numerals", after its
inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the [lambda]
calculus.
</p>

<p>
Define `one' and `two' directly (not in terms of `zero' and
`add-1').  (Hint: Use substitution to evaluate `(add-1 zero)').
Give a direct definition of the addition procedure `+' (not in
terms of repeated application of `add-1').

<p>
   (1) Surprisingly, this idea is very difficult to formulate
rigorously. There are two approaches to giving such a formulation.  One,
pioneered by C. A. R. Hoare (1972), is known as the method of models
"abstract models".  It formalizes the "procedures plus conditions"
specification as outlined in the rational-number example above.  Note
that the condition on the rational-number representation was stated in
terms of facts about integers (equality and division).  In general,
abstract models define new kinds of data objects in terms of previously
defined types of data objects.  Assertions about data objects can
therefore be checked by reducing them to assertions about previously
defined data objects.  Another approach, introduced by Zilles at MIT,
by Goguen, Thatcher, Wagner, and Wright at IBM (see Thatcher, Wagner,
and Wright 1978), and by Guttag at Toronto (see Guttag 1977), is called "algebraic
specification".  It regards the "procedures" as elements of an abstract
algebraic system whose behavior is specified by axioms that correspond
to our "conditions," and uses the techniques of abstract algebra to
check assertions about data objects.  Both methods are surveyed in the
paper by Liskov and Zilles (1975).

<p>
Alyssa P. Hacker is designing a system to help people solve engineering
problems.  One feature she wants to provide in her system is the
ability to manipulate inexact quantities (such as measured parameters
of physical devices) with known precision, so that when computations
are done with such approximate quantities the results will be numbers
of known precision.
</p>

<p>
   Electrical engineers will be using Alyssa's system to compute
electrical quantities.  It is sometimes necessary for them to compute
the value of a parallel equivalent resistance R<sub>p</sub> of two resistors R<sub>1</sub>
and R<sub>2</sub> using the formula
</p>

<p>
	    1
R<sub>p</sub> = --------&#x2013;&#x2014;
      1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
   Resistance values are usually known only up to some tolerance
guaranteed by the manufacturer of the resistor.  For example, if you
buy a resistor labeled "6.8 ohms with 10% tolerance" you can only be
sure that the resistor has a resistance between 6.8 - 0.68 = 6.12 and
6.8 + 0.68 = 7.48 ohms.  Thus, if you have a 6.8-ohm 10% resistor in
parallel with a 4.7-ohm 5% resistor, the resistance of the combination
can range from about 2.58 ohms (if the two resistors are at the lower
bounds) to about 2.97 ohms (if the two resistors are at the upper
bounds).
</p>

<p>
   Alyssa's idea is to implement "interval arithmetic" as a set of
arithmetic operations for combining "intervals" (objects that represent
the range of possible values of an inexact quantity).  The result of
adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two intervals is itself
an interval, representing the range of the result.
</p>

<p>
   Alyssa postulates the existence of an abstract object called an
"interval" that has two endpoints: a lower bound and an upper bound.
She also presumes that, given the endpoints of an interval, she can
construct the interval using the data constructor `make-interval'.
Alyssa first writes a procedure for adding two intervals.  She reasons
that the minimum value the sum could be is the sum of the two lower
bounds and the maximum value it could be is the sum of the two upper
bounds:
</p>

<p>
(define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
		 (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
</p>

<p>
   Alyssa also works out the product of two intervals by finding the
minimum and the maximum of the products of the bounds and using them as
the bounds of the resulting interval.  (`Min' and `max' are primitives
that find the minimum or maximum of any number of arguments.)
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-interval x y)
  (let ((p1 (* (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)))
	(p2 (* (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y)))
	(p3 (* (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y)))
	(p4 (* (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))))
    (make-interval (min p1 p2 p3 p4)
		   (max p1 p2 p3 p4))))
</p>

<p>
   To divide two intervals, Alyssa multiplies the first by the
reciprocal of the second.  Note that the bounds of the reciprocal
interval are the reciprocal of the upper bound and the reciprocal of
the lower bound, in that order.
</p>

<p>
(define (div-interval x y)
  (mul-interval x
		(make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
			       (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y)))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.7:</b> Alyssa's program is incomplete because she has not
specified the implementation of the interval abstraction.  Here is
a definition of the interval constructor:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))
</p>

<p>
Define selectors `upper-bound' and `lower-bound' to complete the
implementation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.8:</b> Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa's, describe
how the difference of two intervals may be computed.  Define a
corresponding subtraction procedure, called `sub-interval'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.9:</b> The "width" of an interval is half of the
difference between its upper and lower bounds.  The width is a
measure of the uncertainty of the number specified by the
interval.  For some arithmetic operations the width of the result
of combining two intervals is a function only of the widths of the
argument intervals, whereas for others the width of the
combination is not a function of the widths of the argument
intervals.  Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of two
intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being
added (or subtracted).  Give examples to show that this is not
true for multiplication or division.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.10:</b> Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer,
looks over Alyssa's shoulder and comments that it is not clear what
it means to divide by an interval that spans zero.  Modify
Alyssa's code to check for this condition and to signal an error
if it occurs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.11:</b> In passing, Ben also cryptically comments: "By
testing the signs of the endpoints of the intervals, it is
possible to break `mul-interval' into nine cases, only one of which
requires more than two multiplications."  Rewrite this procedure
using Ben's suggestion.
</p>

<p>
After debugging her program, Alyssa shows it to a potential user,
who complains that her program solves the wrong problem.  He wants
a program that can deal with numbers represented as a center value
and an additive tolerance; for example, he wants to work with
intervals such as 3.5 +/- 0.15 rather than [3.35, 3.65].  Alyssa
returns to her desk and fixes this problem by supplying an
alternate constructor and alternate selectors:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-center-width c w)
  (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w)))
</p>

<p>
(define (center i)
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2))
</p>

<p>
(define (width i)
  (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, most of Alyssa's users are engineers.  Real
engineering situations usually involve measurements with only a
small uncertainty, measured as the ratio of the width of the
interval to the midpoint of the interval.  Engineers usually
specify percentage tolerances on the parameters of devices, as in
the resistor specifications given earlier.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.12:</b> Define a constructor `make-center-percent' that
takes a center and a percentage tolerance and produces the desired
interval.  You must also define a selector `percent' that produces
the percentage tolerance for a given interval.  The `center'
selector is the same as the one shown above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.13:</b> Show that under the assumption of small
percentage tolerances there is a simple formula for the approximate
percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals in terms of
the tolerances of the factors.  You may simplify the problem by
assuming that all numbers are positive.
</p>

<p>
After considerable work, Alyssa P. Hacker delivers her finished
system.  Several years later, after she has forgotten all about
it, she gets a frenzied call from an irate user, Lem E. Tweakit.
It seems that Lem has noticed that the formula for parallel
resistors can be written in two algebraically equivalent ways:
</p>

<p>
R<sub>1</sub> R<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<hr />
<p>
R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
1
</p>
<hr />
<p>
1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
He has written the following two programs, each of which computes
the parallel-resistors formula differently:
</p>

<p>
(define (par1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
		(add-interval r1 r2)))
</p>

<p>
(define (par2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval one
		  (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
				(div-interval one r2)))))
</p>

<p>
Lem complains that Alyssa's program gives different answers for
the two ways of computing. This is a serious complaint.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.14:</b> Demonstrate that Lem is right.  Investigate the
behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic expressions.
Make some intervals A and B, and use them in computing the
expressions A/A and A/B.  You will get the most insight by using
intervals whose width is a small percentage of the center value.
Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see
*Note Exercise 2-12::).
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.15:</b> Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the
different intervals computed by different but algebraically
equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with
intervals using Alyssa's system will produce tighter error bounds
if it can be written in such a form that no variable that
represents an uncertain number is repeated.  Thus, she says,
`par2' is a "better" program for parallel resistances than `par1'.
Is she right?  Why?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.16:</b> Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic
expressions may lead to different answers.  Can you devise an
interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming,
or is this task impossible?  (Warning: This problem is very
difficult.)

As we have seen, pairs provide a primitive "glue" that we can use to
construct compound data objects.  *Note Figure 2-2:: shows a standard
way to visualize a pair&#x2013;in this case, the pair formed by `(cons 1 2)'.
In this representation, which is called "box-and-pointer notation",
each object is shown as a "pointer" to a box.  The box for a primitive
object contains a representation of the object.  For example, the box
for a number contains a numeral.  The box for a pair is actually a
double box, the left part containing (a pointer to) the `car' of the
pair and the right part containing the `cdr'.

   We have already seen that `cons' can be used to combine not only
numbers but pairs as well.  (You made use of this fact, or should have,
in doing *Note Exercise 2-2:: and *Note Exercise 2-3::.)  As a
consequence, pairs provide a universal building block from which we can

   The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence
of list structure's importance as a representational tool.  We refer to
this ability as the "closure property" of `cons'.  In general, an
operation for combining data objects satisfies the closure property if
the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be
combined using the same operation.(1) Closure is the key to power in
any means of combination because it permits us to create "hierarchical"
structures&#x2013;structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up
of parts, and so on.
</p>

<p>
   From the outset of *Note Chapter 1::, we've made essential use of
closure in dealing with procedures, because all but the very simplest
programs rely on the fact that the elements of a combination can
themselves be combinations.  In this section, we take up the
consequences of closure for compound data.  We describe some
conventional techniques for using pairs to represent sequences and
trees, and we exhibit a graphics language that illustrates closure in a
vivid way.(2)
</p>


<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) The use of the word "closure" here comes from abstract algebra,
where a set of elements is said to be closed under an operation if
applying the operation to elements in the set produces an element that
is again an element of the set.  The Lisp community also
(unfortunately) uses the word "closure" to describe a totally unrelated
concept: A closure is an implementation technique for representing
procedures with free variables.  We do not use the word "closure" in
this second sense in this book.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The notion that a means of combination should satisfy closure is
a straightforward idea.  Unfortunately, the data combiners provided in
many popular programming languages do not satisfy closure, or make
closure cumbersome to exploit.  In Fortran or Basic, one typically
combines data elements by assembling them into arrays&#x2013;but one cannot
form arrays whose elements are themselves arrays.  Pascal and C admit
structures whose elements are structures.  However, this requires that
the programmer manipulate pointers explicitly, and adhere to the
restriction that each field of a structure can contain only elements of
a prespecified form.  Unlike Lisp with its pairs, these languages have
no built-in general-purpose glue that makes it easy to manipulate
compound data in a uniform way.  This limitation lies behind Alan
Perlis's comment in his foreword to this book: "In Pascal the plethora
of declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions
that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation.  It is better to have
100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions
operate on 10 data structures."

<p>
One of the useful structures we can build with pairs is a "sequence"&#x2013;an
ordered collection of data objects.  There are, of course, many ways to
represent sequences in terms of pairs.  One particularly
straightforward representation is illustrated in *Note Figure 2-4::,
where the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 is represented as a chain of pairs.  The
`car' of each pair is the corresponding item in the chain, and the
`cdr' of the pair is the next pair in the chain.  The `cdr' of the
final pair signals the end of the sequence by pointing to a
distinguished value that is not a pair, represented in box-and-pointer
diagrams as a diagonal line and in programs as the value of the
variable `nil'.  The entire sequence is constructed by nested `cons'
operations:
</p>

<p>
(cons 1
      (cons 2
	    (cons 3
		  (cons 4 nil))))
</p>

<p>
   Such a sequence of pairs, formed by nested `cons'es, is called a "list",
and Scheme provides a primitive called `list' to help in constructing
lists.(1)  The above sequence could be produced by `(list 1 2 3 4)'.
In general,
</p>

<p>
(list &lt;A<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;A<sub>2</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;A<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
is equivalent to
</p>

<p>
(cons &lt;A<sub>1</sub>&gt;
      (cons &lt;A<sub>2</sub>&gt;
	    (cons &#x2026;
		  (cons &lt;A<sub>N</sub>&gt;
			nil)
&#x2026;)))
</p>

<p>
   Lisp systems conventionally print lists by printing the sequence of
elements, enclosed in parentheses.  Thus, the data object in *Note
Figure 2-4:: is printed as `(1 2 3 4)':
</p>

<p>
(define one-through-four (list 1 2 3 4))
</p>

<p>
one-through-four
(1 2 3 4)
</p>

<p>
   Be careful not to confuse the expression `(list 1 2 3 4)' with the
list `(1 2 3 4)', which is the result obtained when the expression is
evaluated.  Attempting to evaluate the expression `(1 2 3 4)' will
signal an error when the interpreter tries to apply the procedure `1' to
arguments `2', `3', and `4'.
</p>

<p>
   We can think of `car' as selecting the first item in the list, and of
`cdr' as selecting the sublist consisting of all but the first item.
Nested applications of `car' and `cdr' can be used to extract the
second, third, and subsequent items in the list.(2) The constructor
`cons' makes a list like the original one, but with an additional item
at the beginning.
</p>

<p>
(car one-through-four)
1
</p>

<p>
(cdr one-through-four)
(2 3 4)
</p>

<p>
(car (cdr one-through-four))
2
</p>

<p>
(cons 10 one-through-four)
(10 1 2 3 4)
</p>

<p>
(cons 5 one-through-four)
(5 1 2 3 4)
</p>

<p>
   The value of `nil', used to terminate the chain of pairs, can be
thought of as a sequence of no elements, the "empty list".  The word "nil"
is a contraction of the Latin word <span class="underline">nihil</span>, which means "nothing."(3)
</p>

<p>
List operations
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The use of pairs to represent sequences of elements as lists is
accompanied by conventional programming techniques for manipulating
lists by successively "`cdr'ing down" the lists.  For example, the
procedure `list-ref' takes as arguments a list and a number n and
returns the nth item of the list.  It is customary to number the
elements of the list beginning with 0.  The method for computing
`list-ref' is the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For n = 0, `list-ref' should return the `car' of the list.</li>

<li>Otherwise, `list-ref' should return  the (n - 1)st item of the
`cdr' of the list.</li>
</ul>


<p>
(define (list-ref items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (list-ref (cdr items) (- n 1))))
</p>

<p>
(define squares (list 1 4 9 16 25))
</p>

<p>
(list-ref squares 3)
16
</p>

<p>
   Often we `cdr' down the whole list.  To aid in this, Scheme includes
a primitive predicate `null?', which tests whether its argument is the
empty list.  The procedure `length', which returns the number of items
in a list, illustrates this typical pattern of use:
</p>

<p>
(define (length items)
  (if (null? items)
      0
      (+ 1 (length (cdr items)))))
</p>

<p>
(define odds (list 1 3 5 7))
</p>

<p>
(length odds)
4
</p>

<p>
   The `length' procedure implements a simple recursive plan. The
reduction step is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The `length' of any list is 1 plus the `length' of the `cdr' of
the list.</li>
</ul>


<p>
This is applied successively until we reach the base case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The `length' of the empty list is 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>
We could also compute `length' in an iterative style:
</p>

<p>
(define (length items)
  (define (length-iter a count)
    (if (null? a)
	count
	(length-iter (cdr a) (+ 1 count))))
  (length-iter items 0))
</p>

<p>
   Another conventional programming technique is to "`cons' up" an
answer list while `cdr'ing down a list, as in the procedure `append',
which takes two lists as arguments and combines their elements to make
a new list:
</p>

<p>
(append squares odds)
(1 4 9 16 25 1 3 5 7)
</p>

<p>
(append odds squares)
(1 3 5 7 1 4 9 16 25)
</p>

<p>
   `Append' is also implemented using a recursive plan.  To `append'
lists `list1' and `list2', do the following:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If `list1' is the empty list, then the result is just `list2'.</li>

<li>Otherwise, `append' the `cdr' of `list1' and `list2', and `cons'
the `car' of `list1' onto the result:</li>
</ul>


<p>
(define (append list1 list2)
  (if (null? list1)
      list2
      (cons (car list1) (append (cdr list1) list2))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.17:</b> Define a procedure `last-pair' that returns the
list that contains only the last element of a given (nonempty)
list:
</p>

<p>
(last-pair (list 23 72 149 34))
(34)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.18:</b> Define a procedure `reverse' that takes a list as
argument and returns a list of the same elements in reverse order:
</p>

<p>
(reverse (list 1 4 9 16 25))
(25 16 9 4 1)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.19:</b> Consider the change-counting program of section
*Note 1-2-2::.  It would be nice to be able to easily change the
currency used by the program, so that we could compute the number
of ways to change a British pound, for example.  As the program is
written, the knowledge of the currency is distributed partly into
the procedure `first-denomination' and partly into the procedure
`count-change' (which knows that there are five kinds of U.S.
coins).  It would be nicer to be able to supply a list of coins to
be used for making change.
</p>

<p>
We want to rewrite the procedure `cc' so that its second argument
is a list of the values of the coins to use rather than an integer
specifying which coins to use.  We could then have lists that
defined each kind of currency:
</p>

<p>
(define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
</p>

<p>
(define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
</p>

<p>
We could then call `cc' as follows:
</p>

<p>
(cc 100 us-coins)
292
</p>

<p>
To do this will require changing the program `cc' somewhat.  It
will still have the same form, but it will access its second
argument differently, as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
	((or (&lt; amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
	(else
	 (+ (cc amount
		(except-first-denomination coin-values))
	    (cc (- amount
		   (first-denomination coin-values))
		coin-values)))))
</p>

<p>
Define the procedures `first-denomination',
`except-first-denomination', and `no-more?' in terms of primitive
operations on list structures.  Does the order of the list
`coin-values' affect the answer produced by `cc'?  Why or why not?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.20:</b> The procedures `+', `*', and `list' take
arbitrary numbers of arguments. One way to define such procedures
is to use `define' with notation "dotted-tail notation".  In a
procedure definition, a parameter list that has a dot before the
last parameter name indicates that, when the procedure is called,
the initial parameters (if any) will have as values the initial
arguments, as usual, but the final parameter's value will be a "list"
of any remaining arguments.  For instance, given the definition
</p>

<p>
(define (f x y . z) &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
the procedure `f' can be called with two or more arguments.  If we
evaluate
</p>

<p>
(f 1 2 3 4 5 6)
</p>

<p>
then in the body of `f', `x' will be 1, `y' will be 2, and `z'
will be the list `(3 4 5 6)'.  Given the definition
</p>

<p>
(define (g . w) &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
the procedure `g' can be called with zero or more arguments.  If we
evaluate
</p>

<p>
(g 1 2 3 4 5 6)
</p>

<p>
then in the body of `g', `w' will be the list `(1 2 3 4 5 6)'.(4)
</p>

<p>
Use this notation to write a procedure `same-parity' that takes
one or more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that
have the same even-odd parity as the first argument.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(1 3 5 7)
</p>

<p>
(same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(2 4 6)
</p>

<p>
Mapping over lists
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
One extremely useful operation is to apply some transformation to each
element in a list and generate the list of results.  For instance, the
following procedure scales each number in a list by a given factor:
</p>

<p>
(define (scale-list items factor)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (* (car items) factor)
	    (scale-list (cdr items) factor))))
</p>

<p>
(scale-list (list 1 2 3 4 5) 10)
(10 20 30 40 50)
</p>

<p>
   We can abstract this general idea and capture it as a common pattern
expressed as a higher-order procedure, just as in section *Note 1-3::.
The higher-order procedure here is called `map'.  `Map' takes as
arguments a procedure of one argument and a list, and returns a list of
the results produced by applying the procedure to each element in the
list:(5)
</p>

<p>
(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons (proc (car items))
	    (map proc (cdr items)))))
</p>

<p>
(map abs (list -10 2.5 -11.6 17))
(10 2.5 11.6 17)
</p>

<p>
(map (lambda (x) (* x x))
     (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
</p>

<p>
Now we can give a new definition of `scale-list' in terms of `map':
</p>

<p>
(define (scale-list items factor)
  (map (lambda (x) (* x factor))
       items))
</p>

<p>
   `Map' is an important construct, not only because it captures a
common pattern, but because it establishes a higher level of
abstraction in dealing with lists.  In the original definition of
`scale-list', the recursive structure of the program draws attention to
the element-by-element processing of the list.  Defining `scale-list'
in terms of `map' suppresses that level of detail and emphasizes that
scaling transforms a list of elements to a list of results.  The
difference between the two definitions is not that the computer is
performing a different process (it isn't) but that we think about the
process differently.  In effect, `map' helps establish an abstraction
barrier that isolates the implementation of procedures that transform
lists from the details of how the elements of the list are extracted
and combined.  Like the barriers shown in *Note Figure 2-1::, this
abstraction gives us the flexibility to change the low-level details of
how sequences are implemented, while preserving the conceptual
framework of operations that transform sequences to sequences.  Section
*Note 2-2-3:: expands on this use of sequences as a framework for
organizing programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.21:</b> The procedure `square-list' takes a list of
numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those
numbers.
</p>

<p>
(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)
</p>

<p>
Here are two different definitions of `square-list'.  Complete
both of them by filling in the missing expressions:
</p>

<p>
(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
      nil
      (cons &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;)))
</p>

<p>
(define (square-list items)
  (map &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.22:</b> Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first
`square-list' procedure of *Note Exercise 2-21:: so that it
evolves an iterative process:
</p>

<p>
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
	answer
	(iter (cdr things)
	      (cons (square (car things))
		    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, defining `square-list' this way produces the answer
list in the reverse order of the one desired.  Why?
</p>

<p>
Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to
`cons':
</p>

<p>
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
	answer
	(iter (cdr things)
	      (cons answer
		    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))
</p>

<p>
This doesn't work either.  Explain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.23:</b> The procedure `for-each' is similar to `map'.  It
takes as arguments a procedure and a list of elements.  However,
rather than forming a list of the results, `for-each' just applies
the procedure to each of the elements in turn, from left to right.
The values returned by applying the procedure to the elements are
not used at all&#x2013;`for-each' is used with procedures that perform
an action, such as printing.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
	  (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88
</p>

<p>
The value returned by the call to `for-each' (not illustrated
above) can be something arbitrary, such as true.  Give an
implementation of `for-each'.

   (1) In this book, we use "list" to mean a chain of pairs terminated
by the end-of-list marker.  In contrast, the term "list structure"
refers to any data structure made out of pairs, not just to lists.
</p>

<p>
   (2) Since nested applications of `car' and `cdr' are cumbersome to
write, Lisp dialects provide abbreviations for them&#x2013;for instance,
</p>

<p>
(cadr (ARG)) = (car (cdr (ARG)))
</p>

<p>
   The names of all such procedures start with `c' and end with `r'.
Each `a' between them stands for a `car' operation and each `d' for a
`cdr' operation, to be applied in the same order in which they appear
in the name.  The names `car' and `cdr' persist because simple
combinations like `cadr' are pronounceable.

   (3) It's remarkable how much energy in the standardization of Lisp
dialects has been dissipated in arguments that are literally over
nothing: Should `nil' be an ordinary name?  Should the value of `nil'
be a symbol?  Should it be a list?  Should it be a pair?  In Scheme,
`nil' is an ordinary name, which we use in this section as a variable
whose value is the end-of-list marker (just as `true' is an ordinary
variable that has a true value).  Other dialects of Lisp, including
Common Lisp, treat `nil' as a special symbol.  The authors of this
book, who have endured too many language standardization brawls, would
like to avoid the entire issue.  Once we have introduced quotation in
section *Note 2-3::, we will denote the empty list as `'()' and
dispense with the variable `nil' entirely.
</p>

<p>
(4) To define `f' and `g' using `lambda' we would write
</p>

<p>
(define f (lambda (x y . z) &lt;BODY&gt;))
(define g (lambda w &lt;BODY&gt;))
</p>

<p>
   (5) [Footnote 12] Scheme standardly provides a `map' procedure that
is more general than the one described here.  This more general `map'
takes a procedure of n arguments, together with n lists, and applies
the procedure to all the first elements of the lists, all the second
elements of the lists, and so on, returning a list of the results.  For
example:
</p>

<p>
(map + (list 1 2 3) (list 40 50 60) (list 700 800 900))
(741 852 963)
</p>

<p>
(map (lambda (x y) (+ x (* 2 y)))
     (list 1 2 3)
     (list 4 5 6))
(9 12 15)

The representation of sequences in terms of lists generalizes naturally
to represent sequences whose elements may themselves be sequences.  For
example, we can regard the object `((1 2) 3 4)' constructed by
</p>

<p>
(cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4))
</p>

<p>
as a list of three items, the first of which is itself a list, `(1 2)'.
Indeed, this is suggested by the form in which the result is printed by
the interpreter.  *Note Figure 2-5:: shows the representation of this
structure in terms of pairs.

   Another way to think of sequences whose elements are sequences is as "trees".
The elements of the sequence are the branches of the tree, and
elements that are themselves sequences are subtrees.  *Note Figure 2-6::
shows the structure in *Note Figure 2-5:: viewed as a tree.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.6:</b> The list structure in *Note Figure 2-5:: viewed as a

<p>

</p>

<p>
   Recursion is a natural tool for dealing with tree structures, since
we can often reduce operations on trees to operations on their
branches, which reduce in turn to operations on the branches of the
branches, and so on, until we reach the leaves of the tree.  As an
example, compare the `length' procedure of section *Note 2-2-1:: with
the `count-leaves' procedure, which returns the total number of leaves
of a tree:
</p>

<p>
(define x (cons (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
</p>

<p>
(length x)
3
</p>

<p>
(count-leaves x)
4
</p>

<p>
(list x x)
(((1 2) 3 4) ((1 2) 3 4))
</p>

<p>
(length (list x x))
2
</p>

<p>
(count-leaves (list x x))
8
</p>

<p>
   To implement `count-leaves', recall the recursive plan for computing
`length':
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`Length' of a list `x' is 1 plus `length' of the `cdr' of `x'.</li>

<li>`Length' of the empty list is 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>
`Count-leaves' is similar.  The value for the empty list is the same:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`Count-leaves' of the empty list is 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   But in the reduction step, where we strip off the `car' of the list,
we must take into account that the `car' may itself be a tree whose
leaves we need to count.  Thus, the appropriate reduction step is
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`Count-leaves' of a tree `x' is `count-leaves' of the `car' of `x'
plus `count-leaves' of the `cdr' of `x'.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Finally, by taking `car's we reach actual leaves, so we need another
base case:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`Count-leaves' of a leaf is 1.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   To aid in writing recursive procedures on trees, Scheme provides the
primitive predicate `pair?', which tests whether its argument is a
pair.  Here is the complete procedure:(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (count-leaves x)
  (cond ((null? x) 0)
	((not (pair? x)) 1)
	(else (+ (count-leaves (car x))
		 (count-leaves (cdr x))))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.24:</b> Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list
2 (list 3 4)))'.  Give the result printed by the interpreter, the
corresponding box-and-pointer structure, and the interpretation of
this as a tree (as in *Note Figure 2-6::).
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.25:</b> Give combinations of `car's and `cdr's that will
pick 7 from each of the following lists:
</p>

<p>
(1 3 (5 7) 9)
</p>

<p>
((7))
</p>

<p>
(1 (2 (3 (4 (5 (6 7))))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.26:</b> Suppose we define `x' and `y' to be two lists:
</p>

<p>
(define x (list 1 2 3))
</p>

<p>
(define y (list 4 5 6))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.27:</b> Modify your `reverse' procedure of *Note Exercise
2-18:: to produce a `deep-reverse' procedure that takes a list as
argument and returns as its value the list with its elements
reversed and with all sublists deep-reversed as well.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
</p>

<p>
x
((1 2) (3 4))
</p>

<p>
(reverse x)
((3 4) (1 2))
</p>

<p>
(deep-reverse x)

</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.28:</b> Write a procedure `fringe' that takes as argument
a tree (represented as a list) and returns a list whose elements
are all the leaves of the tree arranged in left-to-right order.

</p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.29:</b> A binary mobile consists of two branches, a left
branch and a right branch.  Each branch is a rod of a certain
length, from which hangs either a weight or another binary mobile.
We can represent a binary mobile using compound data by
constructing it from two branches (for example, using `list'):
</p>

<p>
(define (make-mobile left right)
  (list left right))
</p>

<p>
A branch is constructed from a `length' (which must be a number)
together with a `structure', which may be either a number
(representing a simple weight) or another mobile:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-branch length structure)
  (list length structure))
</p>

<p>
a. Write the corresponding selectors `left-branch' and
   `right-branch', which return the branches of a mobile, and
   `branch-length' and `branch-structure', which return the
   components of a branch.
</p>

<p>
b. Using your selectors, define a procedure `total-weight' that
   returns the total weight of a mobile.
</p>

<p>
c. A mobile is said to be "balanced" if the torque applied by
   its top-left branch is equal to that applied by its top-right
   branch (that is, if the length of the left rod multiplied by
   the weight hanging from that rod is equal to the
   corresponding product for the right side) and if each of the
   submobiles hanging off its branches is balanced. Design a
   predicate that tests whether a binary mobile is balanced.
</p>

<p>
d. Suppose we change the representation of mobiles so that the
   constructors are
</p>

<p>
(define (make-mobile left right)
  (cons left right))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-branch length structure)
  (cons length structure))
</p>

<p>
How much do you need to change your programs to convert to
the new representation?

Mapping over trees
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Just as `map' is a powerful abstraction for dealing with sequences,
`map' together with recursion is a powerful abstraction for dealing with
trees.  For instance, the `scale-tree' procedure, analogous to
`scale-list' of section *Note 2-2-1::, takes as arguments a numeric
factor and a tree whose leaves are numbers.  It returns a tree of the
same shape, where each number is multiplied by the factor.  The
recursive plan for `scale-tree' is similar to the one for
`count-leaves':
</p>

<p>
(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (cond ((null? tree) nil)
	((not (pair? tree)) (* tree factor))
	(else (cons (scale-tree (car tree) factor)
		    (scale-tree (cdr tree) factor)))))
</p>

<p>
(scale-tree (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4) 5) (list 6 7))
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>
(10 (20 (30 40) 50) (60 70))
</p>

<p>
   Another way to implement `scale-tree' is to regard the tree as a
sequence of sub-trees and use `map'.  We map over the sequence, scaling
each sub-tree in turn, and return the list of results.  In the base
case, where the tree is a leaf, we simply multiply by the factor:
</p>

<p>
(define (scale-tree tree factor)
  (map (lambda (sub-tree)
	 (if (pair? sub-tree)
	     (scale-tree sub-tree factor)
	     (* sub-tree factor)))
       tree))
</p>

<p>
   Many tree operations can be implemented by similar combinations of
sequence operations and recursion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.30:</b> Define a procedure `square-tree' analogous to the
`square-list' procedure of *Note Exercise 2-21::.  That is,

       (list 2 (list 3 4) 5)
       (list 6 7)))
(1 (4 (9 16) 25) (36 49))
</p>

<p>
Define `square-tree' both directly (i.e., without using any
higher-order procedures) and also by using `map' and recursion.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.31:</b> Abstract your answer to *Note Exercise 2-30:: to
produce a procedure `tree-map' with the property that
`square-tree' could be defined as
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.32:</b> We can represent a set as a list of distinct
elements, and we can represent the set of all subsets of the set as
a list of lists.  For example, if the set is `(1 2 3)', then the
set of all subsets is `(() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2
3))'.  Complete the following definition of a procedure that
generates the set of subsets of a set and give a clear explanation
of why it works:
</p>

<p>
(define (subsets s)
  (if (null? s)
      (list nil)
      (let ((rest (subsets (cdr s))))
	(append rest (map &lt;??&gt; rest)))))

<p>
In working with compound data, we've stressed how data abstraction
permits us to design programs without becoming enmeshed in the details
of data representations, and how abstraction preserves for us the
flexibility to experiment with alternative representations.  In this
section, we introduce another powerful design principle for working
with data structures&#x2013;the use of "conventional interfaces".
</p>

<p>
   In section *Note 1-3:: we saw how program abstractions, implemented
as higher-order procedures, can capture common patterns in programs
that deal with numerical data.  Our ability to formulate analogous
operations for working with compound data depends crucially on the
style in which we manipulate our data structures.  Consider, for
example, the following procedure, analogous to the `count-leaves'
procedure of section *Note 2-2-2::, which takes a tree as argument and
computes the sum of the squares of the leaves that are odd:
</p>

<p>
(define (sum-odd-squares tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) 0)
	((not (pair? tree))
	 (if (odd? tree) (square tree) 0))
	(else (+ (sum-odd-squares (car tree))
		 (sum-odd-squares (cdr tree))))))
</p>

<p>
   On the surface, this procedure is very different from the following
one, which constructs a list of all the even Fibonacci numbers
_Fib<sub>(k)</sub>, where k is less than or equal to a given integer n:
</p>

<p>
(define (even-fibs n)
  (define (next k)
    (if (&gt; k n)
	nil
	(let ((f (fib k)))
	  (if (even? f)
	      (cons f (next (+ k 1)))
	      (next (+ k 1))))))
  (next 0))
</p>

<p>
   Despite the fact that these two procedures are structurally very
different, a more abstract description of the two computations reveals
a great deal of similarity.  The first program
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>enumerates the leaves of a tree;</li>

<li>filters them, selecting the odd ones;</li>

<li>squares each of the selected ones; and</li>

<li>accumulates the results using `+', starting with 0.</li>
</ul>


<p>
The second program
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>enumerates the integers from 0 to n;</li>

<li>computes the Fibonacci number for each integer;</li>

<li>filters them, selecting the even ones; and</li>

<li>accumulates the results using `cons',  starting with the empty
list.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   A signal-processing engineer would find it natural to conceptualize
these processes in terms of signals flowing through a cascade of
stages, each of which implements part of the program plan, as shown in
*Note Figure 2-7::.  In `sum-odd-squares', we begin with an "enumerator",
which generates a "signal" consisting of the leaves of a given tree.
This signal is passed through a "filter", which eliminates all but the
odd elements.  The resulting signal is in turn passed through a "map",
which is a "transducer" that applies the `square' procedure to each
element.  The output of the map is then fed to an "accumulator", which
combines the elements using `+', starting from an initial 0.  The plan
for `even-fibs' is analogous.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.7:</b> The signal-flow plans for the procedures
`sum-odd-squares' (top) and `even-fibs' (bottom) reveal the
commonality between the two programs.

   Unfortunately, the two procedure definitions above fail to exhibit
this signal-flow structure.  For instance, if we examine the
`sum-odd-squares' procedure, we find that the enumeration is
implemented partly by the `null?' and `pair?' tests and partly by the
tree-recursive structure of the procedure.  Similarly, the accumulation
is found partly in the tests and partly in the addition used in the
recursion.  In general, there are no distinct parts of either procedure
that correspond to the elements in the signal-flow description.  Our
two procedures decompose the computations in a different way, spreading
the enumeration over the program and mingling it with the map, the
filter, and the accumulation.  If we could organize our programs to
make the signal-flow structure manifest in the procedures we write, this
would increase the conceptual clarity of the resulting code.

Sequence Operations

</p>

<p>
The key to organizing programs so as to more clearly reflect the
signal-flow structure is to concentrate on the "signals" that flow from
one stage in the process to the next.  If we represent these signals as
lists, then we can use list operations to implement the processing at
each of the stages.  For instance, we can implement the mapping stages
of the signal-flow diagrams using the `map' procedure from section
*Note 2-2-1:::
</p>

<p>
(map square (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(1 4 9 16 25)
</p>

<p>
   Filtering a sequence to select only those elements that satisfy a
given predicate is accomplished by
</p>

<p>
(define (filter predicate sequence)
  (cond ((null? sequence) nil)
	((predicate (car sequence))
	 (cons (car sequence)
	       (filter predicate (cdr sequence))))
	(else (filter predicate (cdr sequence)))))
</p>

<p>
For example,
</p>

<p>
(filter odd? (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(1 3 5)
</p>

<p>
Accumulations can be implemented by
</p>

<p>
(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
	  (accumulate op initial (cdr sequence)))))
</p>

<p>
(accumulate + 0 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
15
</p>

<p>
(accumulate * 1 (list 1 2 3 4 5))
120
</p>

<p>
(accumulate cons nil (list 1 2 3 4 5))
(1 2 3 4 5)
</p>

<p>
   All that remains to implement signal-flow diagrams is to enumerate
the sequence of elements to be processed.  For `even-fibs', we need to
generate the sequence of integers in a given range, which we can do as
follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (enumerate-interval low high)
  (if (&gt; low high)
      nil
      (cons low (enumerate-interval (+ low 1) high))))
</p>

<p>
(enumerate-interval 2 7)
(2 3 4 5 6 7)
</p>

<p>
To enumerate the leaves of a tree, we can use(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (enumerate-tree tree)
  (cond ((null? tree) nil)
	((not (pair? tree)) (list tree))
	(else (append (enumerate-tree (car tree))
		      (enumerate-tree (cdr tree))))))
</p>

<p>
(enumerate-tree (list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)) 5))
(1 2 3 4 5)
</p>

<p>
   Now we can reformulate `sum-odd-squares' and `even-fibs' as in the
signal-flow diagrams.  For `sum-odd-squares', we enumerate the sequence
of leaves of the tree, filter this to keep only the odd numbers in the
sequence, square each element, and sum the results:
</p>

<p>
(define (sum-odd-squares tree)
  (accumulate +
	      0
	      (map square
		   (filter odd?
			   (enumerate-tree tree)))))
</p>

<p>
   For `even-fibs', we enumerate the integers from 0 to n, generate the
Fibonacci number for each of these integers, filter the resulting
sequence to keep only the even elements, and accumulate the results
into a list:
</p>

<p>
(define (even-fibs n)
  (accumulate cons
	      nil
	      (filter even?
		      (map fib
			   (enumerate-interval 0 n)))))
</p>

<p>
   The value of expressing programs as sequence operations is that this
helps us make program designs that are modular, that is, designs that
are constructed by combining relatively independent pieces.  We can
encourage modular design by providing a library of standard components
together with a conventional interface for connecting the components in
flexible ways.
</p>

<p>
   Modular construction is a powerful strategy for controlling
complexity in engineering design.  In real signal-processing
applications, for example, designers regularly build systems by
cascading elements selected from standardized families of filters and
transducers.  Similarly, sequence operations provide a library of
standard program elements that we can mix and match.  For instance, we
can reuse pieces from the `sum-odd-squares' and `even-fibs' procedures
in a program that constructs a list of the squares of the first n + 1
Fibonacci numbers:
</p>

<p>
(define (list-fib-squares n)
  (accumulate cons
	      nil
	      (map square
		   (map fib
			(enumerate-interval 0 n)))))
</p>

<p>
(list-fib-squares 10)
(0 1 1 4 9 25 64 169 441 1156 3025)
</p>

<p>
   We can rearrange the pieces and use them in computing the product of
the odd integers in a sequence:
</p>

<p>
(define (product-of-squares-of-odd-elements sequence)
  (accumulate *
	      1
	      (map square
		   (filter odd? sequence))))
</p>

<p>
(product-of-squares-of-odd-elements (list 1 2 3 4 5))
225
</p>

<p>
   We can also formulate conventional data-processing applications in
terms of sequence operations.  Suppose we have a sequence of personnel
records and we want to find the salary of the highest-paid programmer.
Assume that we have a selector `salary' that returns the salary of a
record, and a predicate `programmer?' that tests if a record is for a
programmer.  Then we can write
</p>

<p>
(define (salary-of-highest-paid-programmer records)
  (accumulate max
	      0
	      (map salary
		   (filter programmer? records))))
</p>

<p>
   These examples give just a hint of the vast range of operations that
can be expressed as sequence operations.(2)
</p>

<p>
   Sequences, implemented here as lists, serve as a conventional
interface that permits us to combine processing modules.  Additionally,
when we uniformly represent structures as sequences, we have localized
the data-structure dependencies in our programs to a small number of
sequence operations.  By changing these, we can experiment with
alternative representations of sequences, while leaving the overall
design of our programs intact.  We will exploit this capability in
section *Note 3-5::, when we generalize the sequence-processing
paradigm to admit infinite sequences.

<b>Exercise 2.36:</b> The procedure `accumulate-n' is similar to

elements of the sequences, and so on, and returns a sequence of
the results.  For instance, if `s' is a sequence containing four
sequences, `((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9) (10 11 12)),' then the value
of `(accumulate-n + 0 s)' should be the sequence `(22 26 30)'.

this representation, we can use sequence operations to concisely
express the basic matrix and vector operations.  These operations
(which are described in any book on matrix algebra) are the following:
</p>

<p>

<b>Exercise 2.38:</b> The `accumulate' procedure is also known as
`fold-right', because it combines the first element of the

opposite direction:
</p>

Nested Mappings
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
We can extend the sequence paradigm to include many computations that
are commonly expressed using nested loops.(5) Consider this problem:
Given a positive integer n, find all ordered pairs of distinct positive
integers i and j, where 1 &lt;= j&lt; i&lt;= n, such that i + j is prime.  For
example, if n is 6, then the pairs are the following:
</p>

<p>
  i   | 2 3 4 4 5 6 6
  j   | 1 2 1 3 2 1 5
-&#x2013;&#x2014;+----------&#x2013;&#x2014;
i + j | 3 5 5 7 7 7 11
</p>

<p>
   A natural way to organize this computation is to generate the
sequence of all ordered pairs of positive integers less than or equal
to n, filter to select those pairs whose sum is prime, and then, for
each pair (i, j) that passes through the filter, produce the triple
(i,j,i + j).
</p>

<p>
   Here is a way to generate the sequence of pairs: For each integer i
&lt;= n, enumerate the integers j&lt;i, and for each such i and j generate
the pair (i,j).  In terms of sequence operations, we map along the
sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 n)'.  For each i in this sequence, we
map along the sequence `(enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))'.  For each j in
this latter sequence, we generate the pair `(list i j)'.  This gives us
a sequence of pairs for each i.  Combining all the sequences for all
the i (by accumulating with `append') produces the required sequence of
pairs:(6)
</p>

<p>
(accumulate append
	    nil
	    (map (lambda (i)
		   (map (lambda (j) (list i j))
			(enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
		 (enumerate-interval 1 n)))
</p>

<p>
   The combination of mapping and accumulating with `append' is so
common in this sort of program that we will isolate it as a separate
procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (flatmap proc seq)
  (accumulate append nil (map proc seq)))
</p>

<p>
   Now filter this sequence of pairs to find those whose sum is prime.
The filter predicate is called for each element of the sequence; its
argument is a pair and it must extract the integers from the pair.
Thus, the predicate to apply to each element in the sequence is
</p>

<p>
(define (prime-sum? pair)
  (prime? (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
</p>

<p>
   Finally, generate the sequence of results by mapping over the
filtered pairs using the following procedure, which constructs a triple
consisting of the two elements of the pair along with their sum:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-pair-sum pair)
  (list (car pair) (cadr pair) (+ (car pair) (cadr pair))))
</p>

<p>
Combining all these steps yields the complete procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (prime-sum-pairs n)
  (map make-pair-sum
       (filter prime-sum?
	       (flatmap
		(lambda (i)
		  (map (lambda (j) (list i j))
		       (enumerate-interval 1 (- i 1))))
		(enumerate-interval 1 n)))))
</p>

<p>
   Nested mappings are also useful for sequences other than those that
enumerate intervals.  Suppose we wish to generate all the permutations
of a set S; that is, all the ways of ordering the items in the set.
For instance, the permutations of {1,2,3} are {1,2,3}, {1,3,2},
{2,1,3}, {2,3,1}, {3,1,2}, and {3,2,1}.  Here is a plan for generating
the permutations of S: For each item x in S, recursively generate the
sequence of permutations of S - x,(7) and adjoin x to the front of each
one.  This yields, for each x in S, the sequence of permutations of S
that begin with x.  Combining these sequences for all x gives all the
permutations of S:(8)
</p>

<p>
(define (permutations s)
  (if (null? s)                    ; empty set?
      (list nil)                   ; sequence containing empty set
      (flatmap (lambda (x)
		 (map (lambda (p) (cons x p))
		      (permutations (remove x s))))
	       s)))
</p>

<p>
   Notice how this strategy reduces the problem of generating
permutations of S to the problem of generating the permutations of sets
with fewer elements than S.  In the terminal case, we work our way down
to the empty list, which represents a set of no elements.  For this, we
generate `(list nil)', which is a sequence with one item, namely the
set with no elements.  The `remove' procedure used in `permutations'
returns all the items in a given sequence except for a given item.
This can be expressed as a simple filter:
</p>

<p>
(define (remove item sequence)
  (filter (lambda (x) (not (= x item)))
	  sequence))
</p>

<b>Exercise 2.42:</b> The "eight-queens puzzle" asks how to place eight
queens on a chessboard so that no queen is in check from any other
(i.e., no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal).
One possible solution is shown in *Note Figure 2-8::.  One way to
solve the puzzle is to work across the board, placing a queen in
each column.  Once we have placed k - 1 queens, we must place the
kth queen in a position where it does not check any of the queens
already on the board.  We can formulate this approach recursively:
Assume that we have already generated the sequence of all possible
ways to place k - 1 queens in the first k - 1 columns of the
board.  For each of these ways, generate an extended set of
positions by placing a queen in each row of the kth column.  Now
filter these, keeping only the positions for which the queen in
the kth column is safe with respect to the other queens.  This
produces the sequence of all ways to place k queens in the first k
columns.  By continuing this process, we will produce not only one
solution, but all solutions to the puzzle.
</p>

<p>
We implement this solution as a procedure `queens', which returns a
sequence of all solutions to the problem of placing n queens on an
n*n chessboard.  `Queens' has an internal procedure `queen-cols'
that returns the sequence of all ways to place queens in the first
k columns of the board.
</p>

<p>
(define (queens board-size)
  (define (queen-cols k)
    (if (= k 0)
	(list empty-board)
	(filter
	 (lambda (positions) (safe? k positions))
	 (flatmap
	  (lambda (rest-of-queens)
	    (map (lambda (new-row)
		   (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
		 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size)))
	  (queen-cols (- k 1))))))
  (queen-cols board-size))
</p>

<p>
In this procedure `rest-of-queens' is a way to place k - 1 queens
in the first k - 1 columns, and `new-row' is a proposed row in
which to place the queen for the kth column.  Complete the program
by implementing the representation for sets of board positions,
including the procedure `adjoin-position', which adjoins a new
row-column position to a set of positions, and `empty-board',
which represents an empty set of positions.  You must also write
the procedure `safe?', which determines for a set of positions,
whether the queen in the kth column is safe with respect to the
others.  (Note that we need only check whether the new queen is
safe&#x2013;the other queens are already guaranteed safe with respect to
each other.)

<b>Exercise 2.43:</b> Louis Reasoner is having a terrible time doing
*Note Exercise 2-42::.  His `queens' procedure seems to work, but
it runs extremely slowly.  (Louis never does manage to wait long
enough for it to solve even the 6*6 case.)  When Louis asks Eva Lu
Ator for help, she points out that he has interchanged the order
of the nested mappings in the `flatmap', writing it as
</p>

<p>
(flatmap
 (lambda (new-row)
   (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
	  (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))
	(queen-cols (- k 1))))
 (enumerate-interval 1 board-size))
</p>

<p>
Explain why this interchange makes the program run slowly.
Estimate how long it will take Louis's program to solve the
eight-queens puzzle, assuming that the program in *Note Exercise

   (2) Richard Waters (1979) developed a program that automatically
analyzes traditional Fortran programs, viewing them in terms of maps,
filters, and accumulations.  He found that fully 90 percent of the code
in the Fortran Scientific Subroutine Package fits neatly into this
paradigm.  One of the reasons for the success of Lisp as a programming
language is that lists provide a standard medium for expressing ordered
collections so that they can be manipulated using higher-order
operations.  The programming language APL owes much of its power and
appeal to a similar choice. In APL all data are represented as arrays,
and there is a universal and convenient set of generic operators for
all sorts of array operations.

   (3) According to Knuth (1981), this rule was formulated by W. G.
Horner early in the nineteenth century, but the method was actually used
by Newton over a hundred years earlier.  Horner's rule evaluates the
polynomial using fewer additions and multiplications than does the
straightforward method of first computing a<sub>n</sub> x<sup>n</sup>, then adding
a<sub>(n-1)</sub>x<sup>(n-1)</sup>, and so on.  In fact, it is possible to prove that any
algorithm for evaluating arbitrary polynomials must use at least as
many additions and multiplications as does Horner's rule, and thus
Horner's rule is an optimal algorithm for polynomial evaluation.  This
was proved (for the number of additions) by A. M. Ostrowski in a 1954
paper that essentially founded the modern study of optimal algorithms.
The analogous statement for multiplications was proved by V. Y. Pan in

<p>
This section presents a simple language for drawing pictures that
illustrates the power of data abstraction and closure, and also
exploits higher-order procedures in an essential way.  The language is
designed to make it easy to experiment with patterns such as the ones
in *Note Figure 2-9::, which are composed of repeated elements that are
shifted and scaled.(1) In this language, the data objects being
combined are represented as procedures rather than as list structure.
Just as `cons', which satisfies the closure property, allowed us to
easily build arbitrarily complicated list structure, the operations in
this language, which also satisfy the closure property, allow us to
easily build arbitrarily complicated patterns.
</p>

<p>
The picture language
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
When we began our study of programming in section *Note 1-1::, we
emphasized the importance of describing a language by focusing on the
language's primitives, its means of combination, and its means of
abstraction.  We'll follow that framework here.
</p>

<p>
   Part of the elegance of this picture language is that there is only
one kind of element, called a "painter".  A painter draws an image that
is shifted and scaled to fit within a designated parallelogram-shaped
frame.  For example, there's a primitive painter we'll call `wave' that
makes a crude line drawing, as shown in *Note Figure 2-10::.  The
actual shape of the drawing depends on the frame&#x2013;all four images in
*Note Figure 2-10:: are produced by the same `wave' painter, but with
respect to four different frames.  Painters can be more elaborate than
this: The primitive painter called `rogers' paints a picture of MIT's
founder, William Barton Rogers, as shown in *Note Figure 2-11::.(2) The
four images in *Note Figure 2-11:: are drawn with respect to the same
four frames as the `wave' images in *Note Figure 2-10::.
</p>

<p>
   To combine images, we use various operations that construct new
painters from given painters.  For example, the `beside' operation
takes two painters and produces a new, compound painter that draws the
first painter's image in the left half of the frame and the second
painter's image in the right half of the frame.  Similarly, `below'
takes two painters and produces a compound painter that draws the first
painter's image below the second painter's image.  Some operations
transform a single painter to produce a new painter.  For example,
`flip-vert' takes a painter and produces a painter that draws its image
upside-down, and `flip-horiz' produces a painter that draws the
original painter's image left-to-right reversed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.10:</b> Images produced by the `wave' painter, with respect
to four different frames.  The frames, shown with dotted lines,
are not part of the images.

in *Note Figure 2-10:: (original image reprinted with the
permission of the MIT Museum).
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
   *Note Figure 2-12:: shows the drawing of a painter called `wave4'
that is built up in two stages starting from `wave':
</p>

<p>
(define wave2 (beside wave (flip-vert wave)))
(define wave4 (below wave2 wave2))
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.12:</b> Creating a complex figure, starting from the `wave'
painter of *Note Figure 2-10::.
</p>

<p>
[two graphic images not included]
</p>

<p>
(define wave2                         (define wave4
  (beside wave (flip-vert wave)))       (below wave2 wave2))
</p>

<p>
   In building up a complex image in this manner we are exploiting the
fact that painters are closed under the language's means of
combination.  The `beside' or `below' of two painters is itself a
painter; therefore, we can use it as an element in making more complex
painters.  As with building up list structure using `cons', the closure
of our data under the means of combination is crucial to the ability to
create complex structures while using only a few operations.
</p>

<p>
   Once we can combine painters, we would like to be able to abstract
typical patterns of combining painters.  We will implement the painter
operations as Scheme procedures.  This means that we don't need a
special abstraction mechanism in the picture language: Since the means
of combination are ordinary Scheme procedures, we automatically have
the capability to do anything with painter operations that we can do
with procedures.  For example, we can abstract the pattern in `wave4' as
</p>

<p>
(define (flipped-pairs painter)
  (let ((painter2 (beside painter (flip-vert painter))))
    (below painter2 painter2)))
</p>

<p>
and define `wave4' as an instance of this pattern:
</p>

<p>
(define wave4 (flipped-pairs wave))
</p>

<p>
   We can also define recursive operations.  Here's one that makes
painters split and branch towards the right as shown in figures *Note
Figure 2-13:: and *Note Figure 2-14:::
</p>

<p>
(define (right-split painter n)
  (if (= n 0)
      painter
      (let ((smaller (right-split painter (- n 1))))
	(beside painter (below smaller smaller)))))
</p>

<p>
   By placing four copies of a `corner-split' appropriately, we obtain a
pattern called `square-limit', whose application to `wave' and `rogers'
is shown in *Note Figure 2-9:::
</p>

<p>
(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((quarter (corner-split painter n)))
    (let ((half (beside (flip-horiz quarter) quarter)))

Higher-order operations
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
In addition to abstracting patterns of combining painters, we can work
at a higher level, abstracting patterns of combining painter
operations.  That is, we can view the painter operations as elements to
manipulate and can write means of combination for these
elements&#x2013;procedures that take painter operations as arguments and
create new painter operations.
</p>

<p>
   For example, `flipped-pairs' and `square-limit' each arrange four
copies of a painter's image in a square pattern; they differ only in
how they orient the copies.  One way to abstract this pattern of
painter combination is with the following procedure, which takes four
one-argument painter operations and produces a painter operation that
transforms a given painter with those four operations and arranges the
results in a square.  `Tl', `tr', `bl', and `br' are the
transformations to apply to the top left copy, the top right copy, the
bottom left copy, and the bottom right copy, respectively.
</p>

<p>
(define (square-of-four tl tr bl br)
  (lambda (painter)
    (let ((top (beside (tl painter) (tr painter)))
	  (bottom (beside (bl painter) (br painter))))
      (below bottom top))))
</p>

<p>
   Then `flipped-pairs' can be defined in terms of `square-of-four' as
follows:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (flipped-pairs painter)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four identity flip-vert
				  identity flip-vert)))
    (combine4 painter)))
</p>

<p>
and `square-limit' can be expressed as(4)
</p>

<p>
(define (square-limit painter n)
  (let ((combine4 (square-of-four flip-horiz identity
				  rotate180 flip-vert)))
    (combine4 (corner-split painter n))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.45:</b> `Right-split' and `up-split' can be expressed as
instances of a general splitting operation.  Define a procedure
`split' with the property that evaluating
</p>

<p>
(define right-split (split beside below))
(define up-split (split below beside))
</p>

<p>
produces procedures `right-split' and `up-split' with the same
behaviors as the ones already defined.
</p>

<p>
Frames
&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Before we can show how to implement painters and their means of
combination, we must first consider frames.  A frame can be described
by three vectors&#x2013;an origin vector and two edge vectors.  The origin
vector specifies the offset of the frame's origin from some absolute
origin in the plane, and the edge vectors specify the offsets of the
frame's corners from its origin.  If the edges are perpendicular, the
frame will be rectangular.  Otherwise the frame will be a more general
parallelogram.
</p>

<p>
   *Note Figure 2-15:: shows a frame and its associated vectors.  In
accordance with data abstraction, we need not be specific yet about how
frames are represented, other than to say that there is a constructor
`make-frame', which takes three vectors and produces a frame, and three
corresponding selectors `origin-frame', `edge1-frame', and
`edge2-frame' (see *Note Exercise 2-47::).
</p>

<p>

and two edges.

vector       on display screen
</p>

<p>
   We will use coordinates in the unit square (0&lt;= x,y&lt;= 1) to specify
images.  With each frame, we associate a "frame coordinate map", which
will be used to shift and scale images to fit the frame.  The map
transforms the unit square into the frame by mapping the vector v =
(x,y) to the vector sum
</p>

<p>
Origin(Frame) + r * Edge<sub>1</sub>(Frame) + y * Edge<sub>2</sub>(Frame)
</p>

<p>
For example, (0,0) is mapped to the origin of the frame, (1,1) to the
vertex diagonally opposite the origin, and (0.5,0.5) to the center of
the frame.  We can create a frame's coordinate map with the following
procedure:(5)
</p>

<p>
(define (frame-coord-map frame)
  (lambda (v)
    (add-vect
     (origin-frame frame)
     (add-vect (scale-vect (xcor-vect v)
			   (edge1-frame frame))
	       (scale-vect (ycor-vect v)
			   (edge2-frame frame))))))
</p>

<p>
   Observe that applying `frame-coord-map' to a frame returns a
procedure that, given a vector, returns a vector.  If the argument
vector is in the unit square, the result vector will be in the frame.
For example,
</p>

<p>
((frame-coord-map a-frame) (make-vect 0 0))
</p>

<p>
returns the same vector as
</p>

<p>
(origin-frame a-frame)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.46:</b> A two-dimensional vector v running from the
origin to a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an
x-coordinate and a y-coordinate.  Implement a data abstraction for
vectors by giving a constructor `make-vect' and corresponding
selectors `xcor-vect' and `ycor-vect'.  In terms of your selectors
and constructor, implement procedures `add-vect', `sub-vect', and
`scale-vect' that perform the operations vector addition, vector
subtraction, and multiplying a vector by a scalar:
</p>

<p>
(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) + (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) = (x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> + y<sub>2</sub>)
(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) - (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) = (x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>)
	     s * (x, y) = (sx, sy)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.47:</b> Here are two possible constructors for frames:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (list origin edge1 edge2))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-frame origin edge1 edge2)
  (cons origin (cons edge1 edge2)))
</p>

<p>
For each constructor supply the appropriate selectors to produce an
implementation for frames.
</p>

<p>
Painters
&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
A painter is represented as a procedure that, given a frame as
argument, draws a particular image shifted and scaled to fit the frame.
That is to say, if `p' is a painter and `f' is a frame, then we
produce `p''s image in `f' by calling `p' with `f' as argument.
</p>

<p>
   The details of how primitive painters are implemented depend on the
particular characteristics of the graphics system and the type of image
to be drawn.  For instance, suppose we have a procedure `draw-line'
that draws a line on the screen between two specified points.  Then we
can create painters for line drawings, such as the `wave' painter in
*Note Figure 2-10::, from lists of line segments as follows:(6)
</p>

<p>
(define (segments-&gt;painter segment-list)
  (lambda (frame)
    (for-each
     (lambda (segment)
       (draw-line
	((frame-coord-map frame) (start-segment segment))
	((frame-coord-map frame) (end-segment segment))))
     segment-list)))
</p>

<p>
   The segments are given using coordinates with respect to the unit
square.  For each segment in the list, the painter transforms the
segment endpoints with the frame coordinate map and draws a line
between the transformed points.
</p>

<p>
   Representing painters as procedures erects a powerful abstraction
barrier in the picture language.  We can create and intermix all sorts
of primitive painters, based on a variety of graphics capabilities. The
details of their implementation do not matter.  Any procedure can serve
as a painter, provided that it takes a frame as argument and draws
something scaled to fit the frame.(7)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.48:</b> A directed line segment in the plane can be
represented as a pair of vectors&#x2013;the vector running from the
origin to the start-point of the segment, and the vector running
from the origin to the end-point of the segment.  Use your vector
representation from *Note Exercise 2-46:: to define a
representation for segments with a constructor `make-segment' and
selectors `start-segment' and `end-segment'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.49:</b> Use `segments-&gt;painter' to define the following
primitive painters:
</p>

<p>
a. The painter that draws the outline of the designated frame.
</p>

<p>
b. The painter that draws an "X" by connecting opposite corners
   of the frame.
</p>

<p>
c. The painter that draws a diamond shape by connecting the
   midpoints of the sides of the frame.
</p>

<p>
d. The `wave' painter.
</p>


<p>
Transforming and combining painters
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
An operation on painters (such as `flip-vert' or `beside') works by
creating a painter that invokes the original painters with respect to
frames derived from the argument frame.  Thus, for example, `flip-vert'
doesn't have to know how a painter works in order to flip it&#x2013;it just
has to know how to turn a frame upside down: The flipped painter just
uses the original painter, but in the inverted frame.
</p>

<p>
   Painter operations are based on the procedure `transform-painter',
which takes as arguments a painter and information on how to transform
a frame and produces a new painter.  The transformed painter, when
called on a frame, transforms the frame and calls the original painter
on the transformed frame.  The arguments to `transform-painter' are
points (represented as vectors) that specify the corners of the new
frame: When mapped into the frame, the first point specifies the new
frame's origin and the other two specify the ends of its edge vectors.
Thus, arguments within the unit square specify a frame contained within
the original frame.
</p>

<p>
(define (transform-painter painter origin corner1 corner2)
  (lambda (frame)
    (let ((m (frame-coord-map frame)))
      (let ((new-origin (m origin)))
	(painter
	 (make-frame new-origin
		     (sub-vect (m corner1) new-origin)
		     (sub-vect (m corner2) new-origin)))))))
</p>

<p>
Here's how to flip painter images vertically:
</p>

<p>
(define (flip-vert painter)
  (transform-painter painter
		     (make-vect 0.0 1.0)   ; new `origin'
		     (make-vect 1.0 1.0)   ; new end of `edge1'
		     (make-vect 0.0 0.0))) ; new end of `edge2'
</p>

<p>
   Using `transform-painter', we can easily define new transformations.
For example, we can define a painter that shrinks its image to the
upper-right quarter of the frame it is given:
</p>

<p>
(define (shrink-to-upper-right painter)
  (transform-painter painter
		     (make-vect 0.5 0.5)
		     (make-vect 1.0 0.5)
		     (make-vect 0.5 1.0)))
</p>

<p>
Other transformations rotate images counterclockwise by 90 degrees(8)
</p>

<p>
(define (rotate90 painter)
  (transform-painter painter
		     (make-vect 1.0 0.0)
		     (make-vect 1.0 1.0)
		     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)))
</p>

<p>
or squash images towards the center of the frame:(9)
</p>

<p>
(define (squash-inwards painter)
  (transform-painter painter
		     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
		     (make-vect 0.65 0.35)
		     (make-vect 0.35 0.65)))
</p>

<p>
   Frame transformation is also the key to defining means of combining
two or more painters.  The `beside' procedure, for example, takes two
painters, transforms them to paint in the left and right halves of an
argument frame respectively, and produces a new, compound painter.
When the compound painter is given a frame, it calls the first
transformed painter to paint in the left half of the frame and calls
the second transformed painter to paint in the right half of the frame:
</p>

<p>
(define (beside painter1 painter2)
  (let ((split-point (make-vect 0.5 0.0)))
    (let ((paint-left
	   (transform-painter painter1
			      (make-vect 0.0 0.0)
			      split-point
			      (make-vect 0.0 1.0)))
	  (paint-right
	   (transform-painter painter2
			      split-point
			      (make-vect 1.0 0.0)
			      (make-vect 0.5 1.0))))
      (lambda (frame)
	(paint-left frame)
	(paint-right frame)))))
</p>

<p>
   Observe how the painter data abstraction, and in particular the
representation of painters as procedures, makes `beside' easy to
implement.  The `beside' procedure need not know anything about the
details of the component painters other than that each painter will
draw something in its designated frame.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.50:</b> Define the transformation `flip-horiz', which
flips painters horizontally, and transformations that rotate
painters counterclockwise by 180 degrees and 270 degrees.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.51:</b> Define the `below' operation for painters.
`Below' takes two painters as arguments.  The resulting painter,
given a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of the
frame and with the second painter in the top.  Define `below' in
two different ways&#x2013;first by writing a procedure that is analogous
to the `beside' procedure given above, and again in terms of
`beside' and suitable rotation operations (from *Note Exercise
2-50::).

Levels of language for robust design
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The picture language exercises some of the critical ideas we've
introduced about abstraction with procedures and data.  The fundamental
data abstractions, painters, are implemented using procedural
representations, which enables the language to handle different basic
drawing capabilities in a uniform way.  The means of combination
satisfy the closure property, which permits us to easily build up
complex designs.  Finally, all the tools for abstracting procedures are
available to us for abstracting means of combination for painters.
</p>

<p>
   We have also obtained a glimpse of another crucial idea about
languages and program design.  This is the approach of "stratified
design", the notion that a complex system should be structured as a
sequence of levels that are described using a sequence of languages.
Each level is constructed by combining parts that are regarded as
primitive at that level, and the parts constructed at each level are
used as primitives at the next level.  The language used at each level
of a stratified design has primitives, means of combination, and means
of abstraction appropriate to that level of detail.
</p>

<p>
   Stratified design pervades the engineering of complex systems.  For
example, in computer engineering, resistors and transistors are
combined (and described using a language of analog circuits) to produce
parts such as and-gates and or-gates, which form the primitives of a
language for digital-circuit design.(10) These parts are combined to
build processors, bus structures, and memory systems, which are in turn
combined to form computers, using languages appropriate to computer
architecture.  Computers are combined to form distributed systems, using
languages appropriate for describing network interconnections, and so
on.
</p>

<p>
   As a tiny example of stratification, our picture language uses
primitive elements (primitive painters) that are created using a
language that specifies points and lines to provide the lists of line
segments for `segments-&gt;painter', or the shading details for a painter
like `rogers'.  The bulk of our description of the picture language
focused on combining these primitives, using geometric combiners such
as `beside' and `below'.  We also worked at a higher level, regarding
`beside' and `below' as primitives to be manipulated in a language
whose operations, such as `square-of-four', capture common patterns of
combining geometric combiners.
</p>

<p>
   Stratified design helps make programs "robust", that is, it makes it
likely that small changes in a specification will require
correspondingly small changes in the program.  For instance, suppose we
wanted to change the image based on `wave' shown in *Note Figure 2-9::.
We could work at the lowest level to change the detailed appearance of
the `wave' element; we could work at the middle level to change the way
`corner-split' replicates the `wave'; we could work at the highest
level to change how `square-limit' arranges the four copies of the
corner.  In general, each level of a stratified design provides a
different vocabulary for expressing the characteristics of the system,
and a different kind of ability to change it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.52:</b> Make changes to the square limit of `wave' shown
in *Note Figure 2-9:: by working at each of the levels described
above.  In particular:
</p>

<p>
a. Add some segments to the primitive `wave' painter of *Note
   Exercise 2-49:: (to add a smile, for example).
</p>

<p>
b. Change the pattern constructed by `corner-split' (for
   example, by using only one copy of the `up-split' and
   `right-split' images instead of two).
</p>

<p>
c. Modify the version of `square-limit' that uses
   `square-of-four' so as to assemble the corners in a different
   pattern.  (For example, you might make the big Mr. Rogers
   look outward from each corner of the square.)
</p>

<p>
   (1) The picture language is based on the language Peter Henderson
created to construct images like M.C. Escher's "Square Limit" woodcut
(see Henderson 1982).  The woodcut incorporates a repeated scaled
pattern, similar to the arrangements drawn using the `square-limit'
procedure in this section.
</p>

<p>
   (2) William Barton Rogers (1804-1882) was the founder and first
president of MIT.  A geologist and talented teacher, he taught at
William and Mary College and at the University of Virginia.  In 1859 he
moved to Boston, where he had more time for research, worked on a plan
for establishing a "polytechnic institute," and served as
Massachusetts's first State Inspector of Gas Meters.
</p>

<p>
   When MIT was established in 1861, Rogers was elected its first
president.  Rogers espoused an ideal of "useful learning" that was
different from the university education of the time, with its
overemphasis on the classics, which, as he wrote, "stand in the way of
the broader, higher and more practical instruction and discipline of
the natural and social sciences."  This education was likewise to be
different from narrow trade-school education.  In Rogers's words:
</p>

<p>
The world-enforced distinction between the practical and the
scientific worker is utterly futile, and the whole experience of
modern times has demonstrated its utter worthlessness.
</p>

<p>
   Rogers served as president of MIT until 1870, when he resigned due to
ill health.  In 1878 the second president of MIT, John Runkle, resigned
under the pressure of a financial crisis brought on by the Panic of
1873 and strain of fighting off attempts by Harvard to take over MIT.
Rogers returned to hold the office of president until 1881.
</p>

<p>
   Rogers collapsed and died while addressing MIT's graduating class at
the commencement exercises of 1882.  Runkle quoted Rogers's last words
in a memorial address delivered that same year:
</p>

<p>
"As I stand here today and see what the Institute is, &#x2026; I call
to mind the beginnings of science.  I remember one hundred and
fifty years ago Stephen Hales published a pamphlet on the subject
of illuminating gas, in which he stated that his researches had
demonstrated that 128 grains of bituminous coal - " "Bituminous
coal," these were his last words on earth.  Here he bent forward,
as if consulting some notes on the table before him, then slowly
regaining an erect position, threw up his hands, and was
translated from the scene of his earthly labors and triumphs to
"the tomorrow of death," where the mysteries of life are solved,
and the disembodied spirit finds unending satisfaction in
contemplating the new and still unfathomable mysteries of the
infinite future.
</p>

<p>
In the words of Francis A. Walker (MIT's third president):
</p>

<p>
All his life he had borne himself most faithfully and heroically,
and he died as so good a knight would surely have wished, in
harness, at his post, and in the very part and act of public duty.
</p>

<p>
(3) Equivalently, we could write
</p>

<p>
(define flipped-pairs
  (square-of-four identity flip-vert identity flip-vert))
</p>

<p>
   (4) `Rotate180' rotates a painter by 180 degrees (see *Note Exercise
2-50::).  Instead of `rotate180' we could say `(compose flip-vert
flip-horiz)', using the `compose' procedure from *Note Exercise 1-42::.
</p>

<p>
   (5) `Frame-coord-map' uses the vector operations described in *Note
Exercise 2-46:: below, which we assume have been implemented using some
representation for vectors.  Because of data abstraction, it doesn't
matter what this vector representation is, so long as the vector
operations behave correctly.
</p>

<p>
   (6) `Segments-&gt;painter' uses the representation for line segments
described in *Note Exercise 2-48:: below.  It also uses the `for-each'
procedure described in *Note Exercise 2-23::.
</p>

<p>
   (7) For example, the `rogers' painter of *Note Figure 2-11:: was
constructed from a gray-level image.  For each point in a given frame,
the `rogers' painter determines the point in the image that is mapped
to it under the frame coordinate map, and shades it accordingly.  By
allowing different types of painters, we are capitalizing on the
abstract data idea discussed in section *Note 2-1-3::, where we argued
that a rational-number representation could be anything at all that
satisfies an appropriate condition.  Here we're using the fact that a
painter can be implemented in any way at all, so long as it draws
something in the designated frame.  Section *Note 2-1-3:: also showed
how pairs could be implemented as procedures.  Painters are our second
example of a procedural representation for data.
</p>

<p>
   (8) `Rotate90' is a pure rotation only for square frames, because it
also stretches and shrinks the image to fit into the rotated frame.
</p>

<p>
   (9) The diamond-shaped images in figures *Note Figure 2-10:: and
*Note Figure 2-11:: were created with `squash-inwards' applied to
`wave' and `rogers'.
</p>

<p>
(10) Section *Note 3-3-4:: describes one such language.

<p>
All the compound data objects we have used so far were constructed
ultimately from numbers.  In this section we extend the
representational capability of our language by introducing the ability
to work with arbitrary symbols as data.

<h3 id="orgbae29ca"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Quotation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<hr />

<p>
If we can form compound data using symbols, we can have lists such as
</p>

<p>
(a b c d)
(23 45 17)
((Norah 12) (Molly 9) (Anna 7) (Lauren 6) (Charlotte 4))
</p>

<p>
   Lists containing symbols can look just like the expressions of our
language:
</p>

<p>
(* (+ 23 45) (+ x 9))
</p>

<p>
(define (fact n) (if (= n 1) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
</p>

<p>
   In order to manipulate symbols we need a new element in our
language: the ability to "quote" a data object.  Suppose we want to
construct the list `(a b)'.  We can't accomplish this with `(list a
b)', because this expression constructs a list of the "values" of `a'
and `b' rather than the symbols themselves.  This issue is well known
in the context of natural languages, where words and sentences may be
regarded either as semantic entities or as character strings (syntactic
entities).  The common practice in natural languages is to use
quotation marks to indicate that a word or a sentence is to be treated
literally as a string of characters.  For instance, the first letter of
"John" is clearly "J."  If we tell somebody "say your name aloud," we
expect to hear that person's name.  However, if we tell somebody "say
`your name' aloud," we expect to hear the words "your name."  Note that
we are forced to nest quotation marks to describe what somebody else
might say.(1)
</p>

<p>
   We can follow this same practice to identify lists and symbols that
are to be treated as data objects rather than as expressions to be
evaluated.  However, our format for quoting differs from that of
natural languages in that we place a quotation mark (traditionally, the
single quote symbol `'') only at the beginning of the object to be
quoted.  We can get away with this in Scheme syntax because we rely on
blanks and parentheses to delimit objects.  Thus, the meaning of the
single quote character is to quote the next object.(2)
</p>

<p>
Now we can distinguish between symbols and their values:
</p>

<p>
(define a 1)
</p>

<p>
(define b 2)
</p>

<p>
(list a b)
(1 2)
</p>

<p>
(list 'a 'b)
(a b)
</p>

<p>
(list 'a b)
(a 2)
</p>

<p>
   Quotation also allows us to type in compound objects, using the
conventional printed representation for lists:(3)
</p>

<p>
(car '(a b c))
a
</p>

<p>
(cdr '(a b c))
(b c)
</p>

<p>
   In keeping with this, we can obtain the empty list by evaluating
`'()', and thus dispense with the variable `nil'.
</p>

<p>
   One additional primitive used in manipulating symbols is `eq?', which
takes two symbols as arguments and tests whether they are the same.(4)
Using `eq?', we can implement a useful procedure called `memq'.  This
takes two arguments, a symbol and a list.  If the symbol is not
contained in the list (i.e., is not `eq?' to any item in the list),
then `memq' returns false.  Otherwise, it returns the sublist of the
list beginning with the first occurrence of the symbol:
</p>

<p>
(define (memq item x)
  (cond ((null? x) false)
	((eq? item (car x)) x)
	(else (memq item (cdr x)))))
</p>

<p>
For example, the value of
</p>

<p>
(memq 'apple '(pear banana prune))
</p>

<p>
is false, whereas the value of
</p>

<p>
(memq 'apple '(x (apple sauce) y apple pear))
</p>

<p>
is `(apple pear)'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.53:</b> What would the interpreter print in response to
evaluating each of the following expressions?
</p>

<p>
(list 'a 'b 'c)
</p>

<p>
(list (list 'george))
</p>

<p>
(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
</p>

<p>
(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
</p>

<p>
(pair? (car '(a short list)))
</p>

<p>
(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))
</p>

<p>
(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.54:</b> Two lists are said to be `equal?' if they contain
equal elements arranged in the same order.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this is a list))
</p>

<p>
is true, but
</p>

<p>
(equal? '(this is a list) '(this (is a) list))
</p>

<p>
is false.  To be more precise, we can define `equal?'  recursively
in terms of the basic `eq?' equality of symbols by saying that `a'
and `b' are `equal?' if they are both symbols and the symbols are
`eq?', or if they are both lists such that `(car a)' is `equal?'
to `(car b)' and `(cdr a)' is `equal?' to `(cdr b)'.  Using this
idea, implement `equal?' as a procedure.(5)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.55:</b> Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the

</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Allowing quotation in a language wreaks havoc with the ability
to reason about the language in simple terms, because it destroys the
notion that equals can be substituted for equals.  For example, three
is one plus two, but the word "three" is not the phrase "one plus two."
Quotation is powerful because it gives us a way to build expressions
that manipulate other expressions (as we will see when we write an
interpreter in *Note Chapter 4::). But allowing statements in a
language that talk about other statements in that language makes it
very difficult to maintain any coherent principle of what "equals can
be substituted for equals" should mean.  For example, if we know that
the evening star is the morning star, then from the statement "the
evening star is Venus" we can deduce "the morning star is Venus."
However, given that "John knows that the evening star is Venus" we
cannot infer that "John knows that the morning star is Venus."
</p>

<p>
   (2) The single quote is different from the double quote we have been
using to enclose character strings to be printed.  Whereas the single
quote can be used to denote lists or symbols, the double quote is used
only with character strings.  In this book, the only use for character
strings is as items to be printed.
</p>

<p>
   (3) Strictly, our use of the quotation mark violates the general
rule that all compound expressions in our language should be delimited
by parentheses and look like lists.  We can recover this consistency by
introducing a special form `quote', which serves the same purpose as
the quotation mark.  Thus, we would type `(quote a)' instead of `'a',
and we would type `(quote (a b c))' instead of `'(a b c)'.  This is
precisely how the interpreter works.  The quotation mark is just a
single-character abbreviation for wrapping the next complete expression
with `quote' to form `(quote &lt;EXPRESSION&gt;)'.  This is important because
it maintains the principle that any expression seen by the interpreter
can be manipulated as a data object.  For instance, we could construct
the expression `(car '(a b c))', which is the same as `(car (quote (a b
c)))', by evaluating `(list 'car (list 'quote '(a b c)))'.
</p>

<p>
   (4) We can consider two symbols to be "the same" if they consist of
the same characters in the same order.  Such a definition skirts a deep
issue that we are not yet ready to address: the meaning of "sameness"
in a programming language.  We will return to this in *Note Chapter 3::
(section *Note 3-1-3::).
</p>

<p>
   (5) In practice, programmers use `equal?' to compare lists that
contain numbers as well as symbols.  Numbers are not considered to be
symbols.  The question of whether two numerically equal numbers (as
tested by `=') are also `eq?' is highly implementation-dependent.  A
better definition of `equal?' (such as the one that comes as a
primitive in Scheme) would also stipulate that if `a' and `b' are both
numbers, then `a' and `b' are `equal?' if they are numerically equal.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<hr />

<p>
As an illustration of symbol manipulation and a further illustration of
data abstraction, consider the design of a procedure that performs
symbolic differentiation of algebraic expressions.  We would like the
procedure to take as arguments an algebraic expression and a variable
and to return the derivative of the expression with respect to the
variable.  For example, if the arguments to the procedure are ax<sup>2</sup> + bx
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>c and x, the procedure should return 2ax + b.  Symbolic</li>
</ul>
<p>
differentiation is of special historical significance in Lisp.  It was
one of the motivating examples behind the development of a computer
language for symbol manipulation.  Furthermore, it marked the beginning
of the line of research that led to the development of powerful systems
for symbolic mathematical work, which are currently being used by a
growing number of applied mathematicians and physicists.
</p>

<p>
   In developing the symbolic-differentiation program, we will follow
the same strategy of data abstraction that we followed in developing
the rational-number system of section *Note 2-1-1::.  That is, we will
first define a differentiation algorithm that operates on abstract
objects such as "sums," "products," and "variables" without worrying
about how these are to be represented.  Only afterward will we address
the representation problem.
</p>

<p>
The differentiation program with abstract data
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep things simple, we will consider a very simple
symbolic-differentiation program that handles expressions that are
built up using only the operations of addition and multiplication with
two arguments.  Differentiation of any such expression can be carried
out by applying the following reduction rules:
</p>

<p>
dc
&#x2013; = 0  for c a constant, or a variable different from x
dx
</p>

<p>
dx
&#x2013; = 1
dx
</p>

<p>
d(u + v)   du   dv
---&#x2013;&#x2014; = &#x2013; + &#x2013;
   dx      dx   dx
</p>

<p>
d(uv)     / dv \     / du \
&#x2013;&#x2014; = u | &#x2013; | + v | &#x2013; |
 dx       \ dx /     \ dx /
</p>

<p>
   Observe that the latter two rules are recursive in nature.  That is,
to obtain the derivative of a sum we first find the derivatives of the
terms and add them.  Each of the terms may in turn be an expression
that needs to be decomposed.  Decomposing into smaller and smaller
pieces will eventually produce pieces that are either constants or
variables, whose derivatives will be either 0 or 1.
</p>

<p>
   To embody these rules in a procedure we indulge in a little wishful
thinking, as we did in designing the rational-number implementation.
If we had a means for representing algebraic expressions, we should be
able to tell whether an expression is a sum, a product, a constant, or
a variable.  We should be able to extract the parts of an expression.
For a sum, for example we want to be able to extract the addend (first
term) and the augend (second term).  We should also be able to
construct expressions from parts.  Let us assume that we already have
procedures to implement the following selectors, constructors, and
predicates:
</p>

<p>
(variable? e)          Is `e' a variable?
(same-variable? v1 v2) Are `v1' and `v2' the same variable?
(sum? e)               Is `e' a sum?
(addend e)             Addend of the sum `e'.
(augend e)             Augend of the sum `e'.
(make-sum a1 a2)       Construct the sum of `a1' and `a2'.
(product? e)           Is `e' a product?
(multiplier e)         Multiplier of the product `e'.
(multiplicand e)       Multiplicand of the product `e'.
(make-product m1 m2)   Construct the product of `m1' and `m2'.
</p>

<p>
   Using these, and the primitive predicate `number?', which identifies
numbers, we can express the differentiation rules as the following
procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)
	((variable? exp)
	 (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
	((sum? exp)
	 (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)
		   (deriv (augend exp) var)))
	((product? exp)
	 (make-sum
	   (make-product (multiplier exp)
			 (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
	   (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
			 (multiplicand exp))))
	(else
	 (error "unknown expression type &#x2013; DERIV" exp))))
</p>

<p>
   This `deriv' procedure incorporates the complete differentiation
algorithm.  Since it is expressed in terms of abstract data, it will
work no matter how we choose to represent algebraic expressions, as
long as we design a proper set of selectors and constructors.  This is
the issue we must address next.
</p>

</p>

<p>
We can imagine many ways to use list structure to represent algebraic
expressions.  For example, we could use lists of symbols that mirror
the usual algebraic notation, representing ax + b as the list `(a * x +
b)' .  However, one especially straightforward choice is to use the same
parenthesized prefix notation that Lisp uses for combinations; that is,
to represent ax + b as `(+ (* a x) b)'.  Then our data representation
for the differentiation problem is as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The variables are symbols.  They are identified by the primitive
predicate `symbol?':
</p>

<p>
(define (variable? x) (symbol? x))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Two variables are the same if the symbols representing them are
`eq?':
</p>

<p>
(define (same-variable? v1 v2)
  (and (variable? v1) (variable? v2) (eq? v1 v2)))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Sums and products are constructed as lists:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-sum a1 a2) (list '+ a1 a2))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-product m1 m2) (list '* m1 m2))
</p></li>

<li><p>
A sum is a list whose first element is the symbol `+':
</p>

<p>
(define (sum? x)
  (and (pair? x) (eq? (car x) '+)))
</p></li>

<li><p>
The addend is the second item of the sum list:
</p>

<p>
(define (addend s) (cadr s))
</p></li>

<li><p>
The augend is the third item of the sum list:
</p>

<p>
(define (augend s) (caddr s))
</p></li>

<li><p>
A product is a list whose first element is the symbol `*':
</p>

<p>
(define (product? x)
  (and (pair? x) (eq? (car x) '*)))
</p></li>

<li><p>
The multiplier is the second item of the product list:
</p>

<p>
(define (multiplier p) (cadr p))
</p></li>

<li><p>
The multiplicand is the third item of the product list:
</p>

<p>
(define (multiplicand p) (caddr p))
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
   Thus, we need only combine these with the algorithm as embodied by
`deriv' in order to have a working symbolic-differentiation program.
Let us look at some examples of its behavior:
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(+ x 3) 'x)
(+ 1 0)
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(* x y) 'x)
(+ (* x 0) (* 1 y))
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(* (* x y) (+ x 3)) 'x)
   (+ (* (* x y) (+ 1 0))
   (* (+ (* x 0) (* 1 y))
      (+  x 3)))
</p>

<p>
   The program produces answers that are correct; however, they are
unsimplified.  It is true that
</p>

<p>
d(xy)
&#x2013;&#x2014; = x * 0 + 1 * y
 dx
</p>

<p>
but we would like the program to know that x * 0 = 0, 1 * y = y, and 0
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>y = y.  The answer for the second example should have been simply</li>
</ul>
<p>
`y'.  As the third example shows, this becomes a serious issue when the
expressions are complex.
</p>

<p>
   Our difficulty is much like the one we encountered with the
rational-number implementation: we haven't reduced answers to simplest
form.  To accomplish the rational-number reduction, we needed to change
only the constructors and the selectors of the implementation.  We can
adopt a similar strategy here.  We won't change `deriv' at all.
Instead, we will change `make-sum' so that if both summands are
numbers, `make-sum' will add them and return their sum.  Also, if one
of the summands is 0, then `make-sum' will return the other summand.
</p>

<p>
(define (make-sum a1 a2)
  (cond ((=number? a1 0) a2)
	((=number? a2 0) a1)
	((and (number? a1) (number? a2)) (+ a1 a2))
	(else (list '+ a1 a2))))
</p>

<p>
   This uses the procedure `=number?', which checks whether an
expression is equal to a given number:
</p>

<p>
(define (<code>number? exp num)
       (and (number? exp) (</code> exp num)))
</p>

<p>
   Similarly, we will change `make-product' to build in the rules that 0
times anything is 0 and 1 times anything is the thing itself:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-product m1 m2)
  (cond ((or (=number? m1 0) (=number? m2 0)) 0)
	((=number? m1 1) m2)
	((=number? m2 1) m1)
	((and (number? m1) (number? m2)) (* m1 m2))
	(else (list '* m1 m2))))
</p>

<p>
Here is how this version works on our three examples:
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(+ x 3) 'x)
1
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(* x y) 'x)
y
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(* (* x y) (+ x 3)) 'x)
(+ (* x y) (* y (+ x 3)))
</p>

<p>
   Although this is quite an improvement, the third example shows that
there is still a long way to go before we get a program that puts
expressions into a form that we might agree is "simplest."  The problem
of algebraic simplification is complex because, among other reasons, a
form that may be simplest for one purpose may not be for another.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.56:</b> Show how to extend the basic differentiator to
handle more kinds of expressions.  For instance, implement the
differentiation rule
</p>

n<sub>1</sub>   n<sub>2</sub>
&#x2014; = &#x2014;  if and only if n<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub>
d<sub>1</sub>   d<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>
by adding a new clause to the `deriv' program and defining
appropriate procedures `exponentiation?', `base', `exponent', and
`make-exponentiation'.  (You may use the symbol `**' to denote
exponentiation.)  Build in the rules that anything raised to the
power 0 is 1 and anything raised to the power 1 is the thing
itself.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.57:</b> Extend the differentiation program to handle sums
and products of arbitrary numbers of (two or more) terms.  Then
the last example above could be expressed as
</p>

<p>
(deriv '(* x y (+ x 3)) 'x)
</p>

<p>
Try to do this by changing only the representation for sums and
products, without changing the `deriv' procedure at all.  For
example, the `addend' of a sum would be the first term, and the
`augend' would be the sum of the rest of the terms.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.58:</b> Suppose we want to modify the differentiation
program so that it works with ordinary mathematical notation, in
which `+' and `*' are infix rather than prefix operators.  Since
the differentiation program is defined in terms of abstract data,
we can modify it to work with different representations of
expressions solely by changing the predicates, selectors, and
constructors that define the representation of the algebraic
expressions on which the differentiator is to operate.
</p>

<p>
a. Show how to do this in order to differentiate algebraic
   expressions presented in infix form, such as `(x + (3 * (x +
   (y + 2))))'.  To simplify the task, assume that `+' and `*'
   always take two arguments and that expressions are fully
   parenthesized.
</p>

<p>
b. The problem becomes substantially harder if we allow standard
   algebraic notation, such as `(x + 3 * (x + y + 2))', which

   such that our derivative program still works?

<p>
In the previous examples we built representations for two kinds of
compound data objects: rational numbers and algebraic expressions.  In
one of these examples we had the choice of simplifying (reducing) the
expressions at either construction time or selection time, but other
than that the choice of a representation for these structures in terms
of lists was straightforward. When we turn to the representation of
sets, the choice of a representation is not so obvious.  Indeed, there
are a number of possible representations, and they differ significantly
from one another in several ways.
</p>

<p>
   Informally, a set is simply a collection of distinct objects.  To
give a more precise definition we can employ the method of data
abstraction.  That is, we define "set" by specifying the operations
that are to be used on sets.  These are `union-set',
`intersection-set', `element-of-set?', and `adjoin-set'.
`Element-of-set?' is a predicate that determines whether a given
element is a member of a set.  `Adjoin-set' takes an object and a set
as arguments and returns a set that contains the elements of the
original set and also the adjoined element.  `Union-set' computes the
union of two sets, which is the set containing each element that
appears in either argument.  `Intersection-set' computes the
intersection of two sets, which is the set containing only elements
that appear in both arguments.  From the viewpoint of data abstraction,
we are free to design any representation that implements these
operations in a way consistent with the interpretations given above.(1)
</p>

<p>
Sets as unordered lists
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
One way to represent a set is as a list of its elements in which no
element appears more than once.  The empty set is represented by the
empty list.  In this representation, `element-of-set?' is similar to
the procedure `memq' of section *Note 2-3-1::.  It uses `equal?'
instead of `eq?' so that the set elements need not be symbols:
</p>

<p>
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
	((equal? x (car set)) true)
	(else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))
</p>

<p>
   Using this, we can write `adjoin-set'.  If the object to be adjoined
is already in the set, we just return the set.  Otherwise, we use
`cons' to add the object to the list that represents the set:
</p>

<p>
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (if (element-of-set? x set)
      set
      (cons x set)))
</p>

<p>
   For `intersection-set' we can use a recursive strategy.  If we know
how to form the intersection of `set2' and the `cdr' of `set1', we only
need to decide whether to include the `car' of `set1' in this.  But
this depends on whether `(car set1)' is also in `set2'.  Here is the
resulting procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (intersection-set set1 set2)
  (cond ((or (null? set1) (null? set2)) '())
	((element-of-set? (car set1) set2)
	 (cons (car set1)
	       (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2)))
	(else (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2))))
</p>

<p>
   In designing a representation, one of the issues we should be
concerned with is efficiency.  Consider the number of steps required by
our set operations.  Since they all use `element-of-set?', the speed of
this operation has a major impact on the efficiency of the set
implementation as a whole.  Now, in order to check whether an object is
a member of a set, `element-of-set?' may have to scan the entire set.
(In the worst case, the object turns out not to be in the set.)  Hence,
if the set has n elements, `element-of-set?'  might take up to n steps.
Thus, the number of steps required grows as [theta](n).  The number of
steps required by `adjoin-set', which uses this operation, also grows
as [theta](n).  For `intersection-set', which does an `element-of-set?'
check for each element of `set1', the number of steps required grows as
the product of the sizes of the sets involved, or [theta](n<sup>2</sup>) for two
sets of size n.  The same will be true of `union-set'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.59:</b> Implement the `union-set' operation for the
unordered-list representation of sets.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.60:</b> We specified that a set would be represented as a
list with no duplicates.  Now suppose we allow duplicates.  For
instance, the set {1,2,3} could be represented as the list `(2 3 2
1 3 2 2)'.  Design procedures `element-of-set?', `adjoin-set',
`union-set', and `intersection-set' that operate on this
representation.  How does the efficiency of each compare with the
corresponding procedure for the non-duplicate representation?  Are
there applications for which you would use this representation in
preference to the non-duplicate one?
</p>

<p>
Sets as ordered lists
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
One way to speed up our set operations is to change the representation
so that the set elements are listed in increasing order.  To do this,
we need some way to compare two objects so that we can say which is
bigger.  For example, we could compare symbols lexicographically, or we
could agree on some method for assigning a unique number to an object
and then compare the elements by comparing the corresponding numbers.
To keep our discussion simple, we will consider only the case where the
set elements are numbers, so that we can compare elements using `&gt;' and
`&lt;'.  We will represent a set of numbers by listing its elements in
increasing order.  Whereas our first representation above allowed us to
represent the set {1,3,6,10} by listing the elements in any order, our
new representation allows only the list `(1 3 6 10)'.
</p>

<p>
   One advantage of ordering shows up in `element-of-set?': In checking
for the presence of an item, we no longer have to scan the entire set.
If we reach a set element that is larger than the item we are looking
for, then we know that the item is not in the set:
</p>

<p>
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
	((= x (car set)) true)
	((&lt; x (car set)) false)
	(else (element-of-set? x (cdr set)))))
</p>

<p>
   How many steps does this save?  In the worst case, the item we are
looking for may be the largest one in the set, so the number of steps
is the same as for the unordered representation.  On the other hand, if
we search for items of many different sizes we can expect that
sometimes we will be able to stop searching at a point near the
beginning of the list and that other times we will still need to
examine most of the list.  On the average we should expect to have to
examine about half of the items in the set.  Thus, the average number
of steps required will be about n/2.  This is still [theta](n) growth,
but it does save us, on the average, a factor of 2 in number of steps
over the previous implementation.
</p>

<p>
   We obtain a more impressive speedup with `intersection-set'.  In the
unordered representation this operation required [theta](n<sup>2</sup>) steps,
because we performed a complete scan of `set2' for each element of
`set1'.  But with the ordered representation, we can use a more clever
method.  Begin by comparing the initial elements, `x1' and `x2', of the
two sets.  If `x1' equals `x2', then that gives an element of the
intersection, and the rest of the intersection is the intersection of
the `cdr's of the two sets.  Suppose, however, that `x1' is less than
`x2'.  Since `x2' is the smallest element in `set2', we can immediately
conclude that `x1' cannot appear anywhere in `set2' and hence is not in
the intersection.  Hence, the intersection is equal to the intersection
of `set2' with the `cdr' of `set1'.  Similarly, if `x2' is less than
`x1', then the intersection is given by the intersection of `set1' with
the `cdr' of `set2'.  Here is the procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (intersection-set set1 set2)
  (if (or (null? set1) (null? set2))
      '()
      (let ((x1 (car set1)) (x2 (car set2)))
	(cond ((= x1 x2)
	       (cons x1
		     (intersection-set (cdr set1)
				       (cdr set2))))
	      ((&lt; x1 x2)
	       (intersection-set (cdr set1) set2))
	      ((&lt; x2 x1)
	       (intersection-set set1 (cdr set2)))))))
</p>

<p>
   To estimate the number of steps required by this process, observe
that at each step we reduce the intersection problem to computing
intersections of smaller sets&#x2013;removing the first element from `set1'
or `set2' or both.  Thus, the number of steps required is at most the
sum of the sizes of `set1' and `set2', rather than the product of the
sizes as with the unordered representation.  This is [theta](n) growth
rather than [theta](n<sup>2</sup>)&#x2013;a considerable speedup, even for sets of
moderate size.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.61:</b> Give an implementation of `adjoin-set' using the

how to take advantage of the ordering to produce a procedure that

Sets as binary trees
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
We can do better than the ordered-list representation by arranging the
set elements in the form of a tree.  Each node of the tree holds one
element of the set, called the "entry" at that node, and a link to each
of two other (possibly empty) nodes.  The "left" link points to
elements smaller than the one at the node, and the "right" link to
elements greater than the one at the node.  *Note Figure 2-16:: shows
some trees that represent the set {1,3,5,7,9,11}.  The same set may be
represented by a tree in a number of different ways.  The only thing we
require for a valid representation is that all elements in the left
subtree be smaller than the node entry and that all elements in the
right subtree be larger.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.16:</b> Various binary trees that represent the set
{1,3,5,7,9,11}.
</p>

<p>
   7          3             5
   /\         /\            /\
  3  9       1  7          3  9
 /\   \         /\        /   /\
1  5  11       5  9      1   7  11
		   \
		   11
</p>

<p>
   The advantage of the tree representation is this: Suppose we want to
check whether a number x is contained in a set.  We begin by comparing
x with the entry in the top node.  If x is less than this, we know that
we need only search the left subtree; if x is greater, we need only
search the right subtree.  Now, if the tree is "balanced," each of
these subtrees will be about half the size of the original.  Thus, in
one step we have reduced the problem of searching a tree of size n to
searching a tree of size n/2.  Since the size of the tree is halved at
each step, we should expect that the number of steps needed to search a
tree of size n grows as [theta](`log' n).(2) For large sets, this will
be a significant speedup over the previous representations.
</p>

<p>
   We can represent trees by using lists.  Each node will be a list of
three items: the entry at the node, the left subtree, and the right
subtree.  A left or a right subtree of the empty list will indicate
that there is no subtree connected there.  We can describe this
representation by the following procedures:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (entry tree) (car tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (left-branch tree) (cadr tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (right-branch tree) (caddr tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-tree entry left right)
  (list entry left right))
</p>

<p>
   Now we can write the `element-of-set?' procedure using the strategy
described above:
</p>

<p>
(define (element-of-set? x set)
  (cond ((null? set) false)
	((= x (entry set)) true)
	((&lt; x (entry set))
	 (element-of-set? x (left-branch set)))
	((&gt; x (entry set))
	 (element-of-set? x (right-branch set)))))
</p>

<p>
   Adjoining an item to a set is implemented similarly and also requires
[theta](`log' n) steps.  To adjoin an item `x', we compare `x' with the
node entry to determine whether `x' should be added to the right or to
the left branch, and having adjoined `x' to the appropriate branch we
piece this newly constructed branch together with the original entry
and the other branch.  If `x' is equal to the entry, we just return the
node.  If we are asked to adjoin `x' to an empty tree, we generate a
tree that has `x' as the entry and empty right and left branches.  Here
is the procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) (make-tree x '() '()))
	((= x (entry set)) set)
	((&lt; x (entry set))
	 (make-tree (entry set)
		    (adjoin-set x (left-branch set))
		    (right-branch set)))
	((&gt; x (entry set))
	 (make-tree (entry set)
		    (left-branch set)
		    (adjoin-set x (right-branch set))))))
</p>

<p>
   The above claim that searching the tree can be performed in a
logarithmic number of steps rests on the assumption that the tree is
"balanced," i.e., that the left and the right subtree of every tree
have approximately the same number of elements, so that each subtree
contains about half the elements of its parent.  But how can we be
certain that the trees we construct will be balanced?  Even if we start
with a balanced tree, adding elements with `adjoin-set' may produce an
unbalanced result.  Since the position of a newly adjoined element
depends on how the element compares with the items already in the set,
we can expect that if we add elements "randomly" the tree will tend to
be balanced on the average.  But this is not a guarantee.  For example,
if we start with an empty set and adjoin the numbers 1 through 7 in
sequence we end up with the highly unbalanced tree shown in *Note
Figure 2-17::.  In this tree all the left subtrees are empty, so it has
no advantage over a simple ordered list.  One way to solve this problem
is to define an operation that transforms an arbitrary tree into a
balanced tree with the same elements.  Then we can perform this
transformation after every few `adjoin-set' operations to keep our set
in balance.  There are also other ways to solve this problem, most of
which involve designing new data structures for which searching and
insertion both can be done in [theta](`log' n) steps.(4)

`partial-tree' takes as arguments an integer n and list of at

`partial-tree' is a pair (formed with `cons') whose `car' is the

Sets and information retrieval
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
We have examined options for using lists to represent sets and have
seen how the choice of representation for a data object can have a
large impact on the performance of the programs that use the data.
Another reason for concentrating on sets is that the techniques
discussed here appear again and again in applications involving
information retrieval.
</p>

<p>
   Consider a data base containing a large number of individual
records, such as the personnel files for a company or the transactions
in an accounting system.  A typical data-management system spends a
large amount of time accessing or modifying the data in the records and
therefore requires an efficient method for accessing records.  This is
done by identifying a part of each record to serve as an identifying "key".
A key can be anything that uniquely identifies the record.  For a
personnel file, it might be an employee's ID number.  For an accounting
system, it might be a transaction number.  Whatever the key is, when we
define the record as a data structure we should include a `key'
selector procedure that retrieves the key associated with a given
record.
</p>

<p>
   Now we represent the data base as a set of records. To locate the
record with a given key we use a procedure `lookup', which takes as
arguments a key and a data base and which returns the record that has
that key, or false if there is no such record.  `Lookup' is implemented
in almost the same way as `element-of-set?'.  For example, if the set
of records is implemented as an unordered list, we could use
</p>

<p>
(define (lookup given-key set-of-records)
  (cond ((null? set-of-records) false)
	((equal? given-key (key (car set-of-records)))
	 (car set-of-records))
	(else (lookup given-key (cdr set-of-records)))))
</p>

<p>
   Of course, there are better ways to represent large sets than as
unordered lists.  Information-retrieval systems in which records have
to be "randomly accessed" are typically implemented by a tree-based
method, such as the binary-tree representation discussed previously.
In designing such a system the methodology of data abstraction can be a
great help.  The designer can create an initial implementation using a
simple, straightforward representation such as unordered lists.  This
will be unsuitable for the eventual system, but it can be useful in
providing a "quick and dirty" data base with which to test the rest of
the system.  Later on, the data representation can be modified to be
more sophisticated.  If the data base is accessed in terms of abstract
selectors and constructors, this change in representation will not
require any changes to the rest of the system.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.66:</b> Implement the `lookup' procedure for the case
where the set of records is structured as a binary tree, ordered
by the numerical values of the keys.

<p>
   (1) If we want to be more formal, we can specify "consistent with
the interpretations given above" to mean that the operations satisfy a
collection of rules such as these:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any set `S' and any object `x', `(element-of-set? x
(adjoin-set x S))' is true (informally: "Adjoining an object to a
set produces a set that contains the object").</li>

<li>For any sets `S' and `T' and any object `x', `(element-of-set? x
(union-set S T))' is equal to `(or (element-of-set? x S)
(element-of-set? x T))' (informally: "The elements of `(union S
T)' are the elements that are in `S' or in `T'").</li>

<li>For any object `x', `(element-of-set? x '())' is false
(informally: "No object is an element of the empty set").</li>
</ul>


<p>
   (2) Halving the size of the problem at each step is the
distinguishing characteristic of logarithmic growth, as we saw with the
fast-exponentiation algorithm of section *Note 1-2-4:: and the
half-interval search method of section *Note 1-3-3::.
</p>

<p>
   (3) We are representing sets in terms of trees, and trees in terms
of lists&#x2013;in effect, a data abstraction built upon a data abstraction.
We can regard the procedures `entry', `left-branch', `right-branch',
and `make-tree' as a way of isolating the abstraction of a "binary
tree" from the particular way we might wish to represent such a tree in
terms of list structure.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Examples of such structures include "B-trees" and "red-black
trees".  There is a large literature on data structures devoted to this
problem.  See Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest 1990.

<p>
This section provides practice in the use of list structure and data
abstraction to manipulate sets and trees.  The application is to
methods for representing data as sequences of ones and zeros (bits).
For example, the ASCII standard code used to represent text in
computers encodes each character as a sequence of seven bits.  Using
seven bits allows us to distinguish 2<sup>(7)</sup>, or 128, possible different
characters.  In general, if we want to distinguish n different symbols,
we will need to use `log'<sub>2</sub> n bits per symbol.  If all our messages are
made up of the eight symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, we can choose
a code with three bits per character, for example
</p>

<p>
A 000 C 010 E 100 G 110
B 001 D 011 F 101 H 111
</p>

<p>
With this code, the message
</p>

<p>
BACADAEAFABBAAAGAH
</p>

<p>
is encoded as the string of 54 bits
</p>

<p>
001000010000011000100000101000001001000000000110000111
</p>

<p>
   Codes such as ASCII and the A-through-H code above are known as "fixed-length"
codes, because they represent each symbol in the message with the same
number of bits.  It is sometimes advantageous to use "variable-length"
codes, in which different symbols may be represented by different
numbers of bits.  For example, Morse code does not use the same number
of dots and dashes for each letter of the alphabet.  In particular, E,
the most frequent letter, is represented by a single dot.  In general,
if our messages are such that some symbols appear very frequently and
some very rarely, we can encode data more efficiently (i.e., using
fewer bits per message) if we assign shorter codes to the frequent
symbols.  Consider the following alternative code for the letters A
through H:
</p>

<p>
A 0   C 1010  E 1100  G 1110
B 100 D 1011  F 1101  H 1111
</p>

<p>
With this code, the same message as above is encoded as the string
</p>

<p>
100010100101101100011010100100000111001111
</p>

<p>
   This string contains 42 bits, so it saves more than 20% in space in
comparison with the fixed-length code shown above.
</p>

<p>
   One of the difficulties of using a variable-length code is knowing
when you have reached the end of a symbol in reading a sequence of
zeros and ones.  Morse code solves this problem by using a special "separator
code" (in this case, a pause) after the sequence of dots and dashes for
each letter.  Another solution is to design the code in such a way that
no complete code for any symbol is the beginning (or "prefix") of the
code for another symbol.  Such a code is called a "prefix code".  In
the example above, A is encoded by 0 and B is encoded by 100, so no
other symbol can have a code that begins with 0 or with 100.
</p>

<p>
   In general, we can attain significant savings if we use
variable-length prefix codes that take advantage of the relative
frequencies of the symbols in the messages to be encoded.  One
particular scheme for doing this is called the Huffman encoding method,
after its discoverer, David Huffman.  A Huffman code can be represented
as a binary tree whose leaves are the symbols that are encoded.  At
each non-leaf node of the tree there is a set containing all the
symbols in the leaves that lie below the node.  In addition, each
symbol at a leaf is assigned a weight (which is its relative
frequency), and each non-leaf node contains a weight that is the sum of
all the weights of the leaves lying below it.  The weights are not used
in the encoding or the decoding process.  We will see below how they
are used to help construct the tree.
</p>

</p>

<p>
   *Note Figure 2-18:: shows the Huffman tree for the A-through-H code
given above.  The weights at the leaves indicate that the tree was
designed for messages in which A appears with relative frequency 8, B
with relative frequency 3, and the other letters each with relative
frequency 1.
</p>

<p>
   Given a Huffman tree, we can find the encoding of any symbol by
starting at the root and moving down until we reach the leaf that holds
the symbol.  Each time we move down a left branch we add a 0 to the
code, and each time we move down a right branch we add a 1.  (We decide
which branch to follow by testing to see which branch either is the
leaf node for the symbol or contains the symbol in its set.)  For
example, starting from the root of the tree in *Note Figure 2-18::, we
arrive at the leaf for D by following a right branch, then a left
branch, then a right branch, then a right branch; hence, the code for D
is 1011.
</p>

<p>
   To decode a bit sequence using a Huffman tree, we begin at the root
and use the successive zeros and ones of the bit sequence to determine
whether to move down the left or the right branch.  Each time we come
to a leaf, we have generated a new symbol in the message, at which
point we start over from the root of the tree to find the next symbol.
For example, suppose we are given the tree above and the sequence
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Starting at the root, we move down the right branch, (since</li>
</ol>
<p>
the first bit of the string is 1), then down the left branch (since the
second bit is 0), then down the left branch (since the third bit is
also 0).  This brings us to the leaf for B, so the first symbol of the
decoded message is B.  Now we start again at the root, and we make a
left move because the next bit in the string is 0.  This brings us to
the leaf for A.  Then we start again at the root with the rest of the
string 1010, so we move right, left, right, left and reach C.  Thus,
the entire message is BAC.
</p>

Generating Huffman trees
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Given an "alphabet" of symbols and their relative frequencies, how do we
construct the "best" code?  (In other words, which tree will encode
messages with the fewest bits?)  Huffman gave an algorithm for doing
this and showed that the resulting code is indeed the best
variable-length code for messages where the relative frequency of the
symbols matches the frequencies with which the code was constructed.
We will not prove this optimality of Huffman codes here, but we will
show how Huffman trees are constructed.(1)
</p>

<p>
   The algorithm for generating a Huffman tree is very simple. The idea
is to arrange the tree so that the symbols with the lowest frequency
appear farthest away from the root. Begin with the set of leaf nodes,
containing symbols and their frequencies, as determined by the initial
data from which the code is to be constructed. Now find two leaves with
the lowest weights and merge them to produce a node that has these two
nodes as its left and right branches. The weight of the new node is the
sum of the two weights. Remove the two leaves from the original set and
replace them by this new node. Now continue this process. At each step,
merge two nodes with the smallest weights, removing them from the set
and replacing them with a node that has these two as its left and right
branches. The process stops when there is only one node left, which is
the root of the entire tree.  Here is how the Huffman tree of *Note
Figure 2-18:: was generated:
</p>

<p>
Initial leaves {(A 8) (B 3) (C 1) (D 1) (E 1) (F 1) (G 1) (H 1)}
Merge          {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) (E 1) (F 1) (G 1) (H 1)}
Merge          {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F} 2) (G 1) (H 1)}
Merge          {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F} 2) ({G H} 2)}
Merge          {(A 8) (B 3) ({C D} 2) ({E F G H} 4)}
Merge          {(A 8) ({B C D} 5) ({E F G H} 4)}
Merge          {(A 8) ({B C D E F G H} 9)}
Final merge    {({A B C D E F G H} 17)}
</p>

<p>
   The algorithm does not always specify a unique tree, because there
may not be unique smallest-weight nodes at each step.  Also, the choice
of the order in which the two nodes are merged (i.e., which will be the
right branch and which will be the left branch) is arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
Representing Huffman trees
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
In the exercises below we will work with a system that uses Huffman
trees to encode and decode messages and generates Huffman trees
according to the algorithm outlined above.  We will begin by discussing
how trees are represented.
</p>

<p>
   Leaves of the tree are represented by a list consisting of the symbol
`leaf', the symbol at the leaf, and the weight:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-leaf symbol weight)
  (list 'leaf symbol weight))
</p>

<p>
(define (leaf? object)
  (eq? (car object) 'leaf))
</p>

<p>
(define (symbol-leaf x) (cadr x))
</p>

<p>
(define (weight-leaf x) (caddr x))
</p>

<p>
   A general tree will be a list of a left branch, a right branch, a
set of symbols, and a weight.  The set of symbols will be simply a list
of the symbols, rather than some more sophisticated set representation.
When we make a tree by merging two nodes, we obtain the weight of the
tree as the sum of the weights of the nodes, and the set of symbols as
the union of the sets of symbols for the nodes.  Since our symbol sets
are represented as lists, we can form the union by using the `append'
procedure we defined in section *Note 2-2-1:::
</p>

<p>
(define (make-code-tree left right)
  (list left
	right
	(append (symbols left) (symbols right))
	(+ (weight left) (weight right))))
</p>

<p>
If we make a tree in this way, we have the following selectors:
</p>

<p>
(define (left-branch tree) (car tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (right-branch tree) (cadr tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (symbols tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      (list (symbol-leaf tree))
      (caddr tree)))
</p>

<p>
(define (weight tree)
  (if (leaf? tree)
      (weight-leaf tree)
      (cadddr tree)))
</p>

<p>
   The procedures `symbols' and `weight' must do something slightly
different depending on whether they are called with a leaf or a general
tree.  These are simple examples of "generic procedures" (procedures
that can handle more than one kind of data), which we will have much
more to say about in sections *Note 2-4:: and *Note 2-5::.
</p>

<p>
The decoding procedure
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The following procedure implements the decoding algorithm.  It takes as
arguments a list of zeros and ones, together with a Huffman tree.
</p>

<p>
(define (decode bits tree)
  (define (decode-1 bits current-branch)
    (if (null? bits)
	'()
	(let ((next-branch
	       (choose-branch (car bits) current-branch)))
	  (if (leaf? next-branch)
	      (cons (symbol-leaf next-branch)
		    (decode-1 (cdr bits) tree))
	      (decode-1 (cdr bits) next-branch)))))
  (decode-1 bits tree))
</p>

<p>
(define (choose-branch bit branch)
  (cond ((= bit 0) (left-branch branch))
	((= bit 1) (right-branch branch))
	(else (error "bad bit &#x2013; CHOOSE-BRANCH" bit))))
</p>

<p>
   The procedure `decode-1' takes two arguments: the list of remaining
bits and the current position in the tree.  It keeps moving "down" the
tree, choosing a left or a right branch according to whether the next
bit in the list is a zero or a one.  (This is done with the procedure
`choose-branch'.)  When it reaches a leaf, it returns the symbol at
that leaf as the next symbol in the message by `cons'ing it onto the
result of decoding the rest of the message, starting at the root of the
tree.  Note the error check in the final clause of `choose-branch',
which complains if the procedure finds something other than a zero or a
one in the input data.
</p>

<p>
Sets of weighted elements
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
In our representation of trees, each non-leaf node contains a set of
symbols, which we have represented as a simple list.  However, the
tree-generating algorithm discussed above requires that we also work
with sets of leaves and trees, successively merging the two smallest
items.  Since we will be required to repeatedly find the smallest item
in a set, it is convenient to use an ordered representation for this
kind of set.
</p>

<p>
   We will represent a set of leaves and trees as a list of elements,
arranged in increasing order of weight.  The following `adjoin-set'
procedure for constructing sets is similar to the one described in
*Note Exercise 2-61::; however, items are compared by their weights,
and the element being added to the set is never already in it.
</p>

<p>
(define (adjoin-set x set)
  (cond ((null? set) (list x))
	((&lt; (weight x) (weight (car set))) (cons x set))
	(else (cons (car set)
		    (adjoin-set x (cdr set))))))
</p>

<p>
   The following procedure takes a list of symbol-frequency pairs such
as `((A 4) (B 2) (C 1) (D 1))' and constructs an initial ordered set of
leaves, ready to be merged according to the Huffman algorithm:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-leaf-set pairs)
  (if (null? pairs)
      '()
      (let ((pair (car pairs)))
	(adjoin-set (make-leaf (car pair)    ; symbol
			       (cadr pair))  ; frequency
		    (make-leaf-set (cdr pairs))))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.67:</b> Define an encoding tree and a sample message:
</p>

<p>
(define sample-tree
  (make-code-tree (make-leaf 'A 4)
		  (make-code-tree
		   (make-leaf 'B 2)
		   (make-code-tree (make-leaf 'D 1)
				   (make-leaf 'C 1)))))
</p>

<p>
(define sample-message '(0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0))
</p>

<p>
Use the `decode' procedure to decode the message, and give the
result.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.68:</b> The `encode' procedure takes as arguments a
message and a tree and produces the list of bits that gives the
encoded message.
</p>

<p>
(define (encode message tree)
  (if (null? message)
      '()
      (append (encode-symbol (car message) tree)
	      (encode (cdr message) tree))))
</p>

<p>
`Encode-symbol' is a procedure, which you must write, that returns
the list of bits that encodes a given symbol according to a given
tree.  You should design `encode-symbol' so that it signals an
error if the symbol is not in the tree at all.  Test your
procedure by encoding the result you obtained in *Note Exercise
2-67:: with the sample tree and seeing whether it is the same as
the original sample message.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.69:</b> The following procedure takes as its argument a

<p>
`Make-leaf-set' is the procedure given above that transforms the
list of pairs into an ordered set of leaves.  `Successive-merge'
is the procedure you must write, using `make-code-tree' to
successively merge the smallest-weight elements of the set until
there is only one element left, which is the desired Huffman tree.
(This procedure is slightly tricky, but not really complicated.
If you find yourself designing a complex procedure, then you are
almost certainly doing something wrong.  You can take significant
advantage of the fact that we are using an ordered set
representation.)

<h2 id="org8bb3d53"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Multiple Representations for Abstract Data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
We have introduced data abstraction, a methodology for structuring
systems in such a way that much of a program can be specified
independent of the choices involved in implementing the data objects
that the program manipulates.  For example, we saw in section *Note
2-1-1:: how to separate the task of designing a program that uses
rational numbers from the task of implementing rational numbers in
terms of the computer language's primitive mechanisms for constructing
compound data.  The key idea was to erect an abstraction barrier - in
this case, the selectors and constructors for rational numbers
(`make-rat', `numer', `denom')&#x2013;that isolates the way rational numbers
are used from their underlying representation in terms of list
structure.  A similar abstraction barrier isolates the details of the
procedures that perform rational arithmetic (`add-rat', `sub-rat',
`mul-rat', and `div-rat') from the "higher-level" procedures that use
rational numbers.  The resulting program has the structure shown in
*Note Figure 2-1::.
</p>

<p>
   These data-abstraction barriers are powerful tools for controlling
complexity.  By isolating the underlying representations of data
objects, we can divide the task of designing a large program into
smaller tasks that can be performed separately.  But this kind of data
abstraction is not yet powerful enough, because it may not always make
sense to speak of "the underlying representation" for a data object.
</p>

<p>
   For one thing, there might be more than one useful representation
for a data object, and we might like to design systems that can deal
with multiple representations.  To take a simple example, complex
numbers may be represented in two almost equivalent ways: in
rectangular form (real and imaginary parts) and in polar form
(magnitude and angle).  Sometimes rectangular form is more appropriate
and sometimes polar form is more appropriate.  Indeed, it is perfectly
plausible to imagine a system in which complex numbers are represented
in both ways, and in which the procedures for manipulating complex
numbers work with either representation.
</p>

<p>
   More importantly, programming systems are often designed by many
people working over extended periods of time, subject to requirements
that change over time.  In such an environment, it is simply not
possible for everyone to agree in advance on choices of data
representation.  So in addition to the data-abstraction barriers that
isolate representation from use, we need abstraction barriers that
isolate different design choices from each other and permit different
choices to coexist in a single program.  Furthermore, since large
programs are often created by combining pre-existing modules that were
designed in isolation, we need conventions that permit programmers to
incorporate modules into larger systems "additively", that is, without
having to redesign or reimplement these modules.
</p>

<p>
   In this section, we will learn how to cope with data that may be
represented in different ways by different parts of a program.  This
requires constructing "generic procedures"&#x2013;procedures that can operate
on data that may be represented in more than one way.  Our main
technique for building generic procedures will be to work in terms of
data objects that have tags "type tags", that is, data objects that
include explicit information about how they are to be processed.  We
will also discuss "data-directed" programming, a powerful and
convenient implementation strategy for additively assembling systems
with generic operations.
</p>

<p>
   We begin with the simple complex-number example. We will see how
type tags and data-directed style enable us to design separate
rectangular and polar representations for complex numbers while
maintaining the notion of an abstract "complex-number" data object.  We
will accomplish this by defining arithmetic procedures for complex
numbers (`add-complex', `sub-complex', `mul-complex', and
`div-complex') in terms of generic selectors that access parts of a
complex number independent of how the number is represented.  The
resulting complex-number system, as shown in *Note Figure 2-19::,
contains two different kinds of abstraction barriers.  The "horizontal"
abstraction barriers play the same role as the ones in *Note Figure
2-1::.  They isolate "higher-level" operations from "lower-level"
representations.  In addition, there is a "vertical" barrier that gives
us the ability to separately design and install alternative
representations.

<p>
   In section *Note 2-5:: we will show how to use type tags and
data-directed style to develop a generic arithmetic package.  This
provides procedures (`add', `mul', and so on) that can be used to
manipulate all sorts of "numbers" and can be easily extended when a new
kind of number is needed.  In section *Note 2-5-3::, we'll show how to
use generic arithmetic in a system that performs symbolic algebra.

<p>
We will develop a system that performs arithmetic operations on complex
numbers as a simple but unrealistic example of a program that uses
generic operations.  We begin by discussing two plausible
representations for complex numbers as ordered pairs: rectangular form
(real part and imaginary part) and polar form (magnitude and angle).(1)
Section *Note 2-4-2:: will show how both representations can be made
to coexist in a single system through the use of type tags and generic
operations.
</p>

<p>
   Like rational numbers, complex numbers are naturally represented as
ordered pairs.  The set of complex numbers can be thought of as a
two-dimensional space with two orthogonal axes, the "real" axis and the
"imaginary" axis. (See *Note Figure 2-20::.)  From this point of view,
the complex number z = x + iy (where i<sup>2</sup> = - 1) can be thought of as
the point in the plane whose real coordinate is x and whose imaginary
coordinate is y.  Addition of complex numbers reduces in this
representation to addition of coordinates:
</p>

<p>
Real-part(z<sub>1</sub> + z<sub>2</sub>) = Real-part(z<sub>1</sub>) + Real-part(z<sub>2</sub>)
</p>

<p>
Imaginary-part(z<sub>1</sub> + z<sub>2</sub>) = Imaginary-part(z<sub>1</sub>) + Imaginary-part(z<sub>2</sub>)
</p>

<p>
   When multiplying complex numbers, it is more natural to think in
terms of representing a complex number in polar form, as a magnitude
and an angle (r and A in *Note Figure 2-20::).  The product of two
complex numbers is the vector obtained by stretching one complex number
by the length of the other and then rotating it through the angle of
the other:
</p>

<p>
Magnitude(z<sub>1</sub> * z<sub>2</sub>) = Magnitude(z<sub>1</sub>) * Magnitude(z<sub>2</sub>)
</p>

<p>
Angle(z<sub>1</sub> * z<sub>2</sub>) = Angle(z<sub>1</sub>) + Angle(z<sub>2</sub>)
</p>

<p>
   Thus, there are two different representations for complex numbers,
which are appropriate for different operations.  Yet, from the
viewpoint of someone writing a program that uses complex numbers, the
principle of data abstraction suggests that all the operations for
manipulating complex numbers should be available regardless of which
representation is used by the computer.  For example, it is often
useful to be able to find the magnitude of a complex number that is
specified by rectangular coordinates.  Similarly, it is often useful to
be able to determine the real part of a complex number that is
specified by polar coordinates.
</p>

<p>
   To design such a system, we can follow the same data-abstraction
strategy we followed in designing the rational-number package in
section *Note 2-1-1::.  Assume that the operations on complex numbers
are implemented in terms of four selectors: `real-part', `imag-part',
`magnitude', and `angle'.  Also assume that we have two procedures for
constructing complex numbers: `make-from-real-imag' returns a complex
number with specified real and imaginary parts, and `make-from-mag-ang'
returns a complex number with specified magnitude and angle.  These
procedures have the property that, for any complex number `z', both
</p>

<p>
(make-from-real-imag (real-part z) (imag-part z))
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
(make-from-mag-ang (magnitude z) (angle z))
</p>

<p>
produce complex numbers that are equal to `z'.
</p>

<p>
   Using these constructors and selectors, we can implement arithmetic
on complex numbers using the "abstract data" specified by the
constructors and selectors, just as we did for rational numbers in
section *Note 2-1-1::.  As shown in the formulas above, we can add and
subtract complex numbers in terms of real and imaginary parts while
multiplying and dividing complex numbers in terms of magnitudes and
angles:
</p>

<p>
(define (add-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
		       (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (sub-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag (- (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
		       (- (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-mag-ang (* (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
		     (+ (angle z1) (angle z2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (div-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-mag-ang (/ (magnitude z1) (magnitude z2))
		     (- (angle z1) (angle z2))))
</p>

<p>
   To complete the complex-number package, we must choose a
representation and we must implement the constructors and selectors in
terms of primitive numbers and primitive list structure.  There are two
obvious ways to do this: We can represent a complex number in
"rectangular form" as a pair (real part, imaginary part) or in "polar
form" as a pair (magnitude, angle).  Which shall we choose?
</p>

<p>
   In order to make the different choices concrete, imagine that there
are two programmers, Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker, who are
independently designing representations for the complex-number system.
Ben chooses to represent complex numbers in rectangular form.  With
this choice, selecting the real and imaginary parts of a complex number
is straightforward, as is constructing a complex number with given real
and imaginary parts.  To find the magnitude and the angle, or to
construct a complex number with a given magnitude and angle, he uses
the trigonometric relations
</p>

<p>
		      <span class="underline"><span class="underline"><span class="underline"><span class="underline">__</span></span></span></span>
x = r cos A     r = ./ x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<p>
y = r sin A     A = arctan(y,x)
</p>

<p>
which relate the real and imaginary parts (x, y) to the magnitude and
the angle (r, A).(2)  Ben's representation is therefore given by the
following selectors and constructors:
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part z) (car z))
</p>

<p>
(define (imag-part z) (cdr z))
</p>

<p>
(define (magnitude z)
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z)) (square (imag-part z)))))
</p>

<p>
(define (angle z)
  (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag x y) (cons x y))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))
</p>

<p>
   Alyssa, in contrast, chooses to represent complex numbers in polar
form.  For her, selecting the magnitude and angle is straightforward,
but she has to use the trigonometric relations to obtain the real and
imaginary parts.  Alyssa's representation is:
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part z)
  (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (imag-part z)
  (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (magnitude z) (car z))
</p>

<p>
(define (angle z) (cdr z))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
	(atan y x)))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a) (cons r a))
</p>

<p>
   The discipline of data abstraction ensures that the same
implementation of `add-complex', `sub-complex', `mul-complex', and
`div-complex' will work with either Ben's representation or Alyssa's
representation.
</p>

<p>
   (1) In actual computational systems, rectangular form is preferable
to polar form most of the time because of roundoff errors in conversion
between rectangular and polar form.  This is why the complex-number
example is unrealistic.  Nevertheless, it provides a clear illustration
of the design of a system using generic operations and a good
introduction to the more substantial systems to be developed later in
this chapter.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The arctangent function referred to here, computed by Scheme's
`atan' procedure, is defined so as to take two arguments y and x and to
return the angle whose tangent is y/x.  The signs of the arguments
determine the quadrant of the angle.

<p>
One way to view data abstraction is as an application of the "principle
of least commitment."  In implementing the complex-number system in
section *Note 2-4-1::, we can use either Ben's rectangular
representation or Alyssa's polar representation.  The abstraction
barrier formed by the selectors and constructors permits us to defer to
the last possible moment the choice of a concrete representation for
our data objects and thus retain maximum flexibility in our system
design.
</p>

<p>
   The principle of least commitment can be carried to even further
extremes.  If we desire, we can maintain the ambiguity of
representation even <span class="underline">after</span> we have designed the selectors and
constructors, and elect to use both Ben's representation <span class="underline">and</span> Alyssa's
representation.  If both representations are included in a single
system, however, we will need some way to distinguish data in polar
form from data in rectangular form.  Otherwise, if we were asked, for
instance, to find the `magnitude' of the pair (3,4), we wouldn't know
whether to answer 5 (interpreting the number in rectangular form) or 3
(interpreting the number in polar form).  A straightforward way to
accomplish this distinction is to include a "type tag"&#x2013;the symbol
`rectangular' or `polar'&#x2013;as part of each complex number.  Then when we
need to manipulate a complex number we can use the tag to decide which
selector to apply.
</p>

<p>
   In order to manipulate tagged data, we will assume that we have
procedures `type-tag' and `contents' that extract from a data object
the tag and the actual contents (the polar or rectangular coordinates,
in the case of a complex number).  We will also postulate a procedure
`attach-tag' that takes a tag and contents and produces a tagged data
object.  A straightforward way to implement this is to use ordinary
list structure:
</p>

<p>
(define (attach-tag type-tag contents)
  (cons type-tag contents))
</p>

<p>
(define (type-tag datum)
  (if (pair? datum)
      (car datum)
      (error "Bad tagged datum &#x2013; TYPE-TAG" datum)))
</p>

<p>
(define (contents datum)
  (if (pair? datum)
      (cdr datum)
      (error "Bad tagged datum &#x2013; CONTENTS" datum)))
</p>

<p>
   Using these procedures, we can define predicates `rectangular?'  and
`polar?', which recognize polar and rectangular numbers, respectively:
</p>

<p>
(define (rectangular? z)
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'rectangular))
</p>

<p>
(define (polar? z)
  (eq? (type-tag z) 'polar))
</p>

<p>
   With type tags, Ben and Alyssa can now modify their code so that
their two different representations can coexist in the same system.
Whenever Ben constructs a complex number, he tags it as rectangular.
Whenever Alyssa constructs a complex number, she tags it as polar.  In
addition, Ben and Alyssa must make sure that the names of their
procedures do not conflict.  One way to do this is for Ben to append
the suffix `rectangular' to the name of each of his representation
procedures and for Alyssa to append `polar' to the names of hers.  Here
is Ben's revised rectangular representation from section *Note 2-4-1:::
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part-rectangular z) (car z))
</p>

<p>
(define (imag-part-rectangular z) (cdr z))
</p>

<p>
(define (magnitude-rectangular z)
  (sqrt (+ (square (real-part-rectangular z))
	   (square (imag-part-rectangular z)))))
</p>

<p>
(define (angle-rectangular z)
  (atan (imag-part-rectangular z)
	(real-part-rectangular z)))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y)
  (attach-tag 'rectangular (cons x y)))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang-rectangular r a)
  (attach-tag 'rectangular
	      (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a)))))
</p>

<p>
and here is Alyssa's revised polar representation:
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part-polar z)
  (* (magnitude-polar z) (cos (angle-polar z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (imag-part-polar z)
  (* (magnitude-polar z) (sin (angle-polar z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (magnitude-polar z) (car z))
</p>

<p>
(define (angle-polar z) (cdr z))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag-polar x y)
  (attach-tag 'polar
	       (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
		     (atan y x))))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a)
  (attach-tag 'polar (cons r a)))
</p>

<p>
   Each generic selector is implemented as a procedure that checks the
tag of its argument and calls the appropriate procedure for handling
data of that type.  For example, to obtain the real part of a complex
number, `real-part' examines the tag to determine whether to use Ben's
`real-part-rectangular' or Alyssa's `real-part-polar'.  In either case,
we use `contents' to extract the bare, untagged datum and send this to
the rectangular or polar procedure as required:
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
	 (real-part-rectangular (contents z)))
	((polar? z)
	 (real-part-polar (contents z)))
	(else (error "Unknown type &#x2013; REAL-PART" z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (imag-part z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
	 (imag-part-rectangular (contents z)))
	((polar? z)
	 (imag-part-polar (contents z)))
	(else (error "Unknown type &#x2013; IMAG-PART" z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (magnitude z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
	 (magnitude-rectangular (contents z)))
	((polar? z)
	 (magnitude-polar (contents z)))
	(else (error "Unknown type &#x2013; MAGNITUDE" z))))
</p>

<p>
(define (angle z)
  (cond ((rectangular? z)
	 (angle-rectangular (contents z)))
	((polar? z)
	 (angle-polar (contents z)))
	(else (error "Unknown type &#x2013; ANGLE" z))))
</p>

<p>
   To implement the complex-number arithmetic operations, we can use
the same procedures `add-complex', `sub-complex', `mul-complex', and
`div-complex' from section *Note 2-4-1::, because the selectors they
call are generic, and so will work with either representation.  For
example, the procedure `add-complex' is still
</p>

<p>
(define (add-complex z1 z2)
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z1) (real-part z2))
		       (+ (imag-part z1) (imag-part z2))))
</p>

<p>
   Finally, we must choose whether to construct complex numbers using
Ben's representation or Alyssa's representation.  One reasonable choice
is to construct rectangular numbers whenever we have real and imaginary
parts and to construct polar numbers whenever we have magnitudes and
angles:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (make-from-real-imag-rectangular x y))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  (make-from-mag-ang-polar r a))
</p>

       List structure and primitive machine arithmetic
</p>

<p>
   The resulting complex-number system has the structure shown in *Note
Figure 2-21::.  The system has been decomposed into three relatively
independent parts: the complex-number-arithmetic operations, Alyssa's
polar implementation, and Ben's rectangular implementation.  The polar
and rectangular implementations could have been written by Ben and
Alyssa working separately, and both of these can be used as underlying
representations by a third programmer implementing the
complex-arithmetic procedures in terms of the abstract
constructor/selector interface.
</p>

<p>
   Since each data object is tagged with its type, the selectors
operate on the data in a generic manner.  That is, each selector is
defined to have a behavior that depends upon the particular type of
data it is applied to.  Notice the general mechanism for interfacing
the separate representations: Within a given representation
implementation (say, Alyssa's polar package) a complex number is an
untyped pair (magnitude, angle).  When a generic selector operates on a
number of `polar' type, it strips off the tag and passes the contents on
to Alyssa's code.  Conversely, when Alyssa constructs a number for
general use, she tags it with a type so that it can be appropriately
recognized by the higher-level procedures.  This discipline of
stripping off and attaching tags as data objects are passed from level
to level can be an important organizational strategy, as we shall see
in section *Note 2-5::.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
The general strategy of checking the type of a datum and calling an
appropriate procedure is called "dispatching on type".  This is a
powerful strategy for obtaining modularity in system design.  Oh the
other hand, implementing the dispatch as in section *Note 2-4-2:: has
two significant weaknesses.  One weakness is that the generic interface
procedures (`real-part', `imag-part', `magnitude', and `angle') must
know about all the different representations.  For instance, suppose we
wanted to incorporate a new representation for complex numbers into our
complex-number system.  We would need to identify this new
representation with a type, and then add a clause to each of the
generic interface procedures to check for the new type and apply the
appropriate selector for that representation.
</p>

<p>
   Another weakness of the technique is that even though the individual
representations can be designed separately, we must guarantee that no
two procedures in the entire system have the same name.  This is why
Ben and Alyssa had to change the names of their original procedures
from section *Note 2-4-1::.
</p>

<p>
   The issue underlying both of these weaknesses is that the technique
for implementing generic interfaces is not "additive".  The person
implementing the generic selector procedures must modify those
procedures each time a new representation is installed, and the people
interfacing the individual representations must modify their code to
avoid name conflicts.  In each of these cases, the changes that must be
made to the code are straightforward, but they must be made
nonetheless, and this is a source of inconvenience and error.  This is
not much of a problem for the complex-number system as it stands, but
suppose there were not two but hundreds of different representations
for complex numbers.  And suppose that there were many generic
selectors to be maintained in the abstract-data interface.  Suppose, in
fact, that no one programmer knew all the interface procedures or all
the representations.  The problem is real and must be addressed in such
programs as large-scale data-base-management systems.
</p>

<p>
   What we need is a means for modularizing the system design even
further.  This is provided by the programming technique known as programming
"data-directed programming".  To understand how data-directed
programming works, begin with the observation that whenever we deal
with a set of generic operations that are common to a set of different
types we are, in effect, dealing with a two-dimensional table that
contains the possible operations on one axis and the possible types on
the other axis.  The entries in the table are the procedures that
implement each operation for each type of argument presented.  In the
complex-number system developed in the previous section, the
correspondence between operation name, data type, and actual procedure
was spread out among the various conditional clauses in the generic
interface procedures.  But the same information could have been
organized in a table, as shown in *Note Figure 2-22::.
</p>

<p>
   Data-directed programming is the technique of designing programs to
work with such a table directly.  Previously, we implemented the
mechanism that interfaces the complex-arithmetic code with the two
representation packages as a set of procedures that each perform an
explicit dispatch on type.  Here we will implement the interface as a
single procedure that looks up the combination of the operation name
and argument type in the table to find the correct procedure to apply,
and then applies it to the contents of the argument.  If we do this,
then to add a new representation package to the system we need not
change any existing procedures; we need only add new entries to the
table.
</p>

<p>
To implement this plan, assume that we have two procedures, `put' and
`get', for manipulating the operation-and-type table:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`(put &lt;OP&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt; &lt;ITEM&gt;)' installs the `&lt;ITEM&gt;' in the table,
indexed by the `&lt;OP&gt;' and the `&lt;TYPE&gt;'.</li>

<li>`(get &lt;OP&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt;)' looks up the `&lt;OP&gt;', `&lt;TYPE&gt;' entry in the
table and returns the item found there.  If no item is found,
`get' returns false.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   For now, we can assume that `put' and `get' are included in our
language.  In *Note Chapter 3:: (section *Note 3-3-3::, *Note Exercise
3-24::) we will see how to implement these and other operations for
manipulating tables.
</p>

<p>
   Here is how data-directed programming can be used in the
complex-number system.  Ben, who developed the rectangular
representation, implements his code just as he did originally.  He
defines a collection of procedures, or a "package", and interfaces
these to the rest of the system by adding entries to the table that
tell the system how to operate on rectangular numbers.  This is
accomplished by calling the following procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (install-rectangular-package)
  ;; internal procedures
  (define (real-part z) (car z))
  (define (imag-part z) (cdr z))
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y) (cons x y))
  (define (magnitude z)
    (sqrt (+ (square (real-part z))
	     (square (imag-part z)))))
  (define (angle z)
    (atan (imag-part z) (real-part z)))
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
    (cons (* r (cos a)) (* r (sin a))))
</p>

<p>
;; interface to the rest of the system
(define (tag x) (attach-tag 'rectangular x))
(put 'real-part '(rectangular) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(rectangular) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(rectangular) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(rectangular) angle)
(put 'make-from-real-imag 'rectangular
     (lambda (x y) (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))
(put 'make-from-mag-ang 'rectangular
     (lambda (r a) (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))
'done)
</p>

<p>
   Notice that the internal procedures here are the same procedures
from section *Note 2-4-1:: that Ben wrote when he was working in
isolation.  No changes are necessary in order to interface them to the
rest of the system.  Moreover, since these procedure definitions are
internal to the installation procedure, Ben needn't worry about name
conflicts with other procedures outside the rectangular package.  To
interface these to the rest of the system, Ben installs his `real-part'
procedure under the operation name `real-part' and the type
`(rectangular)', and similarly for the other selectors.(1)  The
interface also defines the constructors to be used by the external
system.(2)  These are identical to Ben's internally defined
constructors, except that they attach the tag.
</p>

<p>
Alyssa's polar package is analogous:
</p>

<p>
(define (install-polar-package)
  ;; internal procedures
  (define (magnitude z) (car z))
  (define (angle z) (cdr z))
  (define (make-from-mag-ang r a) (cons r a))
  (define (real-part z)
    (* (magnitude z) (cos (angle z))))
  (define (imag-part z)
    (* (magnitude z) (sin (angle z))))
  (define (make-from-real-imag x y)
    (cons (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y)))
	  (atan y x)))
</p>

<p>
;; interface to the rest of the system
(define (tag x) (attach-tag 'polar x))
(put 'real-part '(polar) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(polar) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(polar) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(polar) angle)
(put 'make-from-real-imag 'polar
     (lambda (x y) (tag (make-from-real-imag x y))))
(put 'make-from-mag-ang 'polar
     (lambda (r a) (tag (make-from-mag-ang r a))))
'done)
</p>

<p>
   Even though Ben and Alyssa both still use their original procedures
defined with the same names as each other's (e.g., `real-part'), these
definitions are now internal to different procedures (see section *Note
1-1-8::), so there is no name conflict.
</p>

<p>
   The complex-arithmetic selectors access the table by means of a
general "operation" procedure called `apply-generic', which applies a
generic operation to some arguments.  `Apply-generic' looks in the
table under the name of the operation and the types of the arguments
and applies the resulting procedure if one is present:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
	  (apply proc (map contents args))
	  (error
	    "No method for these types &#x2013; APPLY-GENERIC"
	    (list op type-tags))))))
</p>

<p>
   Using `apply-generic', we can define our generic selectors as
follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (real-part z) (apply-generic 'real-part z))
(define (imag-part z) (apply-generic 'imag-part z))
(define (magnitude z) (apply-generic 'magnitude z))
(define (angle z) (apply-generic 'angle z))
</p>

<p>
   Observe that these do not change at all if a new representation is
added to the system.
</p>

<p>
   We can also extract from the table the constructors to be used by
the programs external to the packages in making complex numbers from
real and imaginary parts and from magnitudes and angles.  As in section
*Note 2-4-2::, we construct rectangular numbers whenever we have real
and imaginary parts, and polar numbers whenever we have magnitudes and
angles:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  ((get 'make-from-real-imag 'rectangular) x y))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-mag-ang r a)
  ((get 'make-from-mag-ang 'polar) r a))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.73:</b> Section *Note 2-3-2:: described a program that
performs symbolic differentiation:
</p>

<p>
(define (deriv exp var)
  (cond ((number? exp) 0)
	((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
	((sum? exp)
	 (make-sum (deriv (addend exp) var)
		   (deriv (augend exp) var)))
	((product? exp)
	 (make-sum
	   (make-product (multiplier exp)
			 (deriv (multiplicand exp) var))
	   (make-product (deriv (multiplier exp) var)
			 (multiplicand exp))))
	&lt;MORE RULES CAN BE ADDED HERE&gt;
	(else (error "unknown expression type &#x2013; DERIV" exp))))
</p>

<p>
We can regard this program as performing a dispatch on the type of
the expression to be differentiated.  In this situation the "type
tag" of the datum is the algebraic operator symbol (such as `+')
and the operation being performed is `deriv'.  We can transform
this program into data-directed style by rewriting the basic
derivative procedure as
</p>

<p>
(define (deriv exp var)
   (cond ((number? exp) 0)
	 ((variable? exp) (if (same-variable? exp var) 1 0))
	 (else ((get 'deriv (operator exp)) (operands exp)

<p>

<p>
b. Write the procedures for derivatives of sums and products,
   and the auxiliary code required to install them in the table

   install it in this data-directed system.
</p>

<p>
d. In this simple algebraic manipulator the type of an
   expression is the algebraic operator that binds it together.

<b>Exercise 2.74:</b> Insatiable Enterprises, Inc., is a highly
decentralized conglomerate company consisting of a large number of
independent divisions located all over the world.  The company's
computer facilities have just been interconnected by means of a
clever network-interfacing scheme that makes the entire network
appear to any user to be a single computer.  Insatiable's
president, in her first attempt to exploit the ability of the
network to extract administrative information from division files,
is dismayed to discover that, although all the division files have
been implemented as data structures in Scheme, the particular data
structure used varies from division to division.  A meeting of
division managers is hastily called to search for a strategy to
integrate the files that will satisfy headquarters' needs while
preserving the existing autonomy of the divisions.
</p>

<p>
Show how such a strategy can be implemented with data-directed
programming.  As an example, suppose that each division's
personnel records consist of a single file, which contains a set
of records keyed on employees' names.  The structure of the set
varies from division to division.  Furthermore, each employee's
record is itself a set (structured differently from division to
division) that contains information keyed under identifiers such
as `address' and `salary'.  In particular:
</p>

<p>
a. Implement for headquarters a `get-record' procedure that
   retrieves a specified employee's record from a specified
   personnel file.  The procedure should be applicable to any
   division's file.  Explain how the individual divisions' files
   should be structured.  In particular, what type information
   must be supplied?
</p>

<p>
b. Implement for headquarters a `get-salary' procedure that
   returns the salary information from a given employee's record
   from any division's personnel file.  How should the record be
   structured in order to make this operation work?
</p>

<p>
c. Implement for headquarters a `find-employee-record'
   procedure.  This should search all the divisions' files for
   the record of a given employee and return the record.  Assume
   that this procedure takes as arguments an employee's name and
   a list of all the divisions' files.
</p>

<p>
d. When Insatiable takes over a new company, what changes must
   be made in order to incorporate the new personnel information
   into the central system?

<p>
Message passing
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The key idea of data-directed programming is to handle generic
operations in programs by dealing explicitly with operation-and-type
tables, such as the table in *Note Figure 2-22::.  The style of
programming we used in section *Note 2-4-2:: organized the required
dispatching on type by having each operation take care of its own
dispatching.  In effect, this decomposes the operation-and-type table
into rows, with each generic operation procedure representing a row of
the table.
</p>

<p>
   An alternative implementation strategy is to decompose the table
into columns and, instead of using "intelligent operations" that
dispatch on data types, to work with "intelligent data objects" that
dispatch on operation names.  We can do this by arranging things so
that a data object, such as a rectangular number, is represented as a
procedure that takes as input the required operation name and performs
the operation indicated.  In such a discipline, `make-from-real-imag'
could be written as
</p>

<p>
(define (make-from-real-imag x y)
  (define (dispatch op)
    (cond ((eq? op 'real-part) x)
	  ((eq? op 'imag-part) y)
	  ((eq? op 'magnitude)
	   (sqrt (+ (square x) (square y))))
	  ((eq? op 'angle) (atan y x))
	  (else
	   (error "Unknown op &#x2013; MAKE-FROM-REAL-IMAG" op))))
  dispatch)
</p>

<p>
   The corresponding `apply-generic' procedure, which applies a generic
operation to an argument, now simply feeds the operation's name to the
data object and lets the object do the work:(4)
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-generic op arg) (arg op))
</p>

<p>
   Note that the value returned by `make-from-real-imag' is a
procedure&#x2013;the internal `dispatch' procedure.  This is the procedure
that is invoked when `apply-generic' requests an operation to be
performed.
</p>

<p>
   This style of programming is called "message passing".  The name
comes from the image that a data object is an entity that receives the
requested operation name as a "message."  We have already seen an
example of message passing in section *Note 2-1-3::, where we saw how
`cons', `car', and `cdr' could be defined with no data objects but only
procedures.  Here we see that message passing is not a mathematical
trick but a useful technique for organizing systems with generic
operations.  In the remainder of this chapter we will continue to use
data-directed programming, rather than message passing, to discuss
generic arithmetic operations.  In *Note Chapter 3:: we will return to
message passing, and we will see that it can be a powerful tool for
structuring simulation programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.75:</b> Implement the constructor `make-from-mag-ang' in
message-passing style.  This procedure should be analogous to the
`make-from-real-imag' procedure given above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.76:</b> As a large system with generic operations
evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed.
For each of the three strategies&#x2013;generic operations with explicit
dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style&#x2013;describe
the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new
types or new operations.  Which organization would be most
appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added?
Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new
operations must often be added?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
   (1) We use the list `(rectangular)' rather than the symbol
`rectangular' to allow for the possibility of operations with multiple
arguments, not all of the same type.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The type the constructors are installed under needn't be a list
because a constructor is always used to make an object of one
particular type.
</p>

<p>
   (3) `Apply-generic' uses the dotted-tail notation described in *Note
Exercise 2-20::, because different generic operations may take
different numbers of arguments.  In `apply-generic', `op' has as its
value the first argument to `apply-generic' and `args' has as its value
a list of the remaining arguments.
</p>

<p>
   `Apply-generic' also uses the primitive procedure `apply', which
takes two arguments, a procedure and a list.  `Apply' applies the
procedure, using the elements in the list as arguments.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(apply + (list 1 2 3 4))
</p>

<p>
returns 10.
</p>

<p>
   (4) One limitation of this organization is it permits only generic
procedures of one argument.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In the previous section, we saw how to design systems in which data
objects can be represented in more than one way.  The key idea is to
link the code that specifies the data operations to the several
representations by means of generic interface procedures.  Now we will
see how to use this same idea not only to define operations that are
generic over different representations but also to define operations
that are generic over different kinds of arguments.  We have already
seen several different packages of arithmetic operations: the primitive
arithmetic (`+', `-', `*', `/') built into our language, the
rational-number arithmetic (`add-rat', `sub-rat', `mul-rat', `div-rat')
of section *Note 2-1-1::, and the complex-number arithmetic that we
implemented in section *Note 2-4-3::.  We will now use data-directed
techniques to construct a package of arithmetic operations that
incorporates all the arithmetic packages we have already constructed.
</p>

<p>
   *Note Figure 2-23:: shows the structure of the system we shall
build.  Notice the abstraction barriers.  From the perspective of
someone using "numbers," there is a single procedure `add' that
operates on whatever numbers are supplied.  `Add' is part of a generic
interface that allows the separate ordinary-arithmetic,
rational-arithmetic, and complex-arithmetic packages to be accessed
uniformly by programs that use numbers.  Any individual arithmetic
package (such as the complex package) may itself be accessed through
generic procedures (such as `add-complex') that combine packages
designed for different representations (such as rectangular and polar).
Moreover, the structure of the system is additive, so that one can
design the individual arithmetic packages separately and combine them
to produce a generic arithmetic system.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
The task of designing generic arithmetic operations is analogous to
that of designing the generic complex-number operations.  We would
like, for instance, to have a generic addition procedure `add' that
acts like ordinary primitive addition `+' on ordinary numbers, like
`add-rat' on rational numbers, and like `add-complex' on complex
numbers.  We can implement `add', and the other generic arithmetic
operations, by following the same strategy we used in section *Note
2-4-3:: to implement the generic selectors for complex numbers.  We
will attach a type tag to each kind of number and cause the generic
procedure to dispatch to an appropriate package according to the data
type of its arguments.
</p>

<p>
The generic arithmetic procedures are defined as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (add x y) (apply-generic 'add x y))
(define (sub x y) (apply-generic 'sub x y))
(define (mul x y) (apply-generic 'mul x y))
(define (div x y) (apply-generic 'div x y))
</p>

<p>
   We begin by installing a package for handling "ordinary" numbers,
that is, the primitive numbers of our language.  We will tag these with
the symbol `scheme-number'.  The arithmetic operations in this package
are the primitive arithmetic procedures (so there is no need to define
extra procedures to handle the untagged numbers).  Since these
operations each take two arguments, they are installed in the table
keyed by the list `(scheme-number scheme-number)':
</p>

<p>
(define (install-scheme-number-package)
  (define (tag x)
    (attach-tag 'scheme-number x))
  (put 'add '(scheme-number scheme-number)

   Now that the framework of the generic arithmetic system is in place,
we can readily include new kinds of numbers.  Here is a package that
performs rational arithmetic.  Notice that, as a benefit of additivity,
we can use without modification the rational-number code from section

	      (* (denom x) (denom y))))
  (define (sub-rat x y)
    (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
		 (* (numer y) (denom x)))
	      (* (denom x) (denom y))))
  (define (mul-rat x y)
    (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
	      (* (denom x) (denom y))))
  (define (div-rat x y)

	      (* (denom x) (numer y))))
</p>

   We can install a similar package to handle complex numbers, using
the tag `complex'.  In creating the package, we extract from the table
the operations `make-from-real-imag' and `make-from-mag-ang' that were
defined by the rectangular and polar packages.  Additivity permits us
to use, as the internal operations, the same `add-complex',
`sub-complex', `mul-complex', and `div-complex' procedures from section
*Note 2-4-1::.

<p>
   Programs outside the complex-number package can construct complex
numbers either from real and imaginary parts or from magnitudes and
angles.  Notice how the underlying procedures, originally defined in
the rectangular and polar packages, are exported to the complex
package, and exported from there to the outside world.

   What we have here is a two-level tag system.  A typical complex
number, such as 3 + 4i in rectangular form, would be represented as
shown in *Note Figure 2-24::.  The outer tag (`complex') is used to
direct the number to the complex package.  Once within the complex
package, the next tag (`rectangular') is used to direct the number to
the rectangular package.  In a large and complicated system there might
be many levels, each interfaced with the next by means of generic
operations.  As a data object is passed "downward," the outer tag that
is used to direct it to the appropriate package is stripped off (by
applying `contents') and the next level of tag (if any) becomes visible
to be used for further dispatching.
</p>

   In the above packages, we used `add-rat', `add-complex', and the
other arithmetic procedures exactly as originally written.  Once these
definitions are internal to different installation procedures, however,
they no longer need names that are distinct from each other: we could
simply name them `add', `sub', `mul', and `div' in both packages.
</p>

<b>Exercise 2.77:</b> Louis Reasoner tries to evaluate the expression
`(magnitude z)' where `z' is the object shown in *Note Figure
2-24::.  To his surprise, instead of the answer 5 he gets an error
message from `apply-generic', saying there is no method for the
operation `magnitude' on the types `(complex)'.  He shows this
interaction to Alyssa P. Hacker, who says "The problem is that the
complex-number selectors were never defined for `complex' numbers,
just for `polar' and `rectangular' numbers.  All you have to do to
make this work is add the following to the `complex' package:"
</p>

<p>
(put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(complex) angle)
</p>

<p>
Describe in detail why this works.  As an example, trace through
all the procedures called in evaluating the expression `(magnitude
z)' where `z' is the object shown in *Note Figure 2-24::.  In
particular, how many times is `apply-generic' invoked?  What
procedure is dispatched to in each case?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.78:</b> The internal procedures in the `scheme-number'
package are essentially nothing more than calls to the primitive
procedures `+', `-', etc.  It was not possible to use the
primitives of the language directly because our type-tag system
requires that each data object have a type attached to it.  In
fact, however, all Lisp implementations do have a type system,
which they use internally.  Primitive predicates such as `symbol?'
and `number?'  determine whether data objects have particular
types.  Modify the definitions of `type-tag', `contents', and
`attach-tag' from section *Note 2-4-2:: so that our generic system
takes advantage of Scheme's internal type system.  That is to say,
the system should work as before except that ordinary numbers
should be represented simply as Scheme numbers rather than as
pairs whose `car' is the symbol `scheme-number'.

<h3 id="org66f4bbb"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Combining Data of Different Types</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
We have seen how to define a unified arithmetic system that encompasses
ordinary numbers, complex numbers, rational numbers, and any other type
of number we might decide to invent, but we have ignored an important
issue.  The operations we have defined so far treat the different data
types as being completely independent.  Thus, there are separate
packages for adding, say, two ordinary numbers, or two complex numbers.
What we have not yet considered is the fact that it is meaningful to
define operations that cross the type boundaries, such as the addition
of a complex number to an ordinary number.  We have gone to great pains
to introduce barriers between parts of our programs so that they can be
developed and understood separately.  We would like to introduce the
cross-type operations in some carefully controlled way, so that we can
support them without seriously violating our module boundaries.
</p>

<p>
   One way to handle cross-type operations is to design a different
procedure for each possible combination of types for which the
operation is valid.  For example, we could extend the complex-number
package so that it provides a procedure for adding complex numbers to
ordinary numbers and installs this in the table using the tag `(complex
scheme-number)':(1)
</p>

<p>
;; to be included in the complex package
(define (add-complex-to-schemenum z x)
  (make-from-real-imag (+ (real-part z) x)
		       (imag-part z)))
</p>

<p>
(put 'add '(complex scheme-number)
     (lambda (z x) (tag (add-complex-to-schemenum z x))))
</p>

<p>
   This technique works, but it is cumbersome.  With such a system, the
cost of introducing a new type is not just the construction of the
package of procedures for that type but also the construction and
installation of the procedures that implement the cross-type
operations.  This can easily be much more code than is needed to define
the operations on the type itself.  The method also undermines our
ability to combine separate packages additively, or least to limit the
extent to which the implementors of the individual packages need to
take account of other packages.  For instance, in the example above, it
seems reasonable that handling mixed operations on complex numbers and
ordinary numbers should be the responsibility of the complex-number
package.  Combining rational numbers and complex numbers, however,
might be done by the complex package, by the rational package, or by
some third package that uses operations extracted from these two
packages.  Formulating coherent policies on the division of
responsibility among packages can be an overwhelming task in designing
systems with many packages and many cross-type operations.
</p>

<p>
Coercion
&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
In the general situation of completely unrelated operations acting on
completely unrelated types, implementing explicit cross-type operations,
cumbersome though it may be, is the best that one can hope for.
Fortunately, we can usually do better by taking advantage of additional
structure that may be latent in our type system.  Often the different
data types are not completely independent, and there may be ways by
which objects of one type may be viewed as being of another type.  This
process is called "coercion".  For example, if we are asked to
arithmetically combine an ordinary number with a complex number, we can
view the ordinary number as a complex number whose imaginary part is
zero.  This transforms the problem to that of combining two complex
numbers, which can be handled in the ordinary way by the
complex-arithmetic package.
</p>

<p>
   In general, we can implement this idea by designing coercion
procedures that transform an object of one type into an equivalent
object of another type.  Here is a typical coercion procedure, which
transforms a given ordinary number to a complex number with that real
part and zero imaginary part:
</p>

<p>
(define (scheme-number-&gt;complex n)
  (make-complex-from-real-imag (contents n) 0))
</p>

<p>
   We install these coercion procedures in a special coercion table,
indexed under the names of the two types:
</p>

<p>
(put-coercion 'scheme-number 'complex scheme-number-&gt;complex)
</p>

<p>
   (We assume that there are `put-coercion' and `get-coercion'
procedures available for manipulating this table.)  Generally some of
the slots in the table will be empty, because it is not generally
possible to coerce an arbitrary data object of each type into all other
types.  For example, there is no way to coerce an arbitrary complex
number to an ordinary number, so there will be no general
`complex-&gt;scheme-number' procedure included in the table.
</p>

<p>
   Once the coercion table has been set up, we can handle coercion in a
uniform manner by modifying the `apply-generic' procedure of section
*Note 2-4-3::.  When asked to apply an operation, we first check
whether the operation is defined for the arguments' types, just as
before.  If so, we dispatch to the procedure found in the
operation-and-type table.  Otherwise, we try coercion.  For simplicity,
we consider only the case where there are two arguments.(2)  We check
the coercion table to see if objects of the first type can be coerced
to the second type.  If so, we coerce the first argument and try the
operation again.  If objects of the first type cannot in general be
coerced to the second type, we try the coercion the other way around to
see if there is a way to coerce the second argument to the type of the
first argument.  Finally, if there is no known way to coerce either
type to the other type, we give up.  Here is the procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-generic op . args)
  (let ((type-tags (map type-tag args)))
    (let ((proc (get op type-tags)))
      (if proc
	  (apply proc (map contents args))
	  (if (= (length args) 2)
	      (let ((type1 (car type-tags))
		    (type2 (cadr type-tags))
		    (a1 (car args))
		    (a2 (cadr args)))
		(let ((t1-&gt;t2 (get-coercion type1 type2))
		      (t2-&gt;t1 (get-coercion type2 type1)))
		  (cond (t1-&gt;t2
			 (apply-generic op (t1-&gt;t2 a1) a2))
			(t2-&gt;t1
			 (apply-generic op a1 (t2-&gt;t1 a2)))
			(else
			 (error "No method for these types"
				(list op type-tags))))))
	      (error "No method for these types"
		     (list op type-tags)))))))
</p>

<p>
   This coercion scheme has many advantages over the method of defining
explicit cross-type operations, as outlined above.  Although we still
need to write coercion procedures to relate the types (possibly n<sup>2</sup>
procedures for a system with n types), we need to write only one
procedure for each pair of types rather than a different procedure for
each collection of types and each generic operation.(3)  What we are
counting on here is the fact that the appropriate transformation
between types depends only on the types themselves, not on the
operation to be applied.
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, there may be applications for which our coercion
scheme is not general enough.  Even when neither of the objects to be
combined can be converted to the type of the other it may still be
possible to perform the operation by converting both objects to a third
type.  In order to deal with such complexity and still preserve
modularity in our programs, it is usually necessary to build systems
that take advantage of still further structure in the relations among
types, as we discuss next.
</p>

<p>
Hierarchies of types
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The coercion scheme presented above relied on the existence of natural
relations between pairs of types.  Often there is more "global"
structure in how the different types relate to each other.  For
instance, suppose we are building a generic arithmetic system to handle
integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers.  In such
a system, it is quite natural to regard an integer as a special kind of
rational number, which is in turn a special kind of real number, which
is in turn a special kind of complex number.  What we actually have is
a so-called "hierarchy of types", in which, for example, integers are a "subtype"
of rational numbers (i.e., any operation that can be applied to a
rational number can automatically be applied to an integer).
Conversely, we say that rational numbers form a "supertype" of
integers.  The particular hierarchy we have here is of a very simple
kind, in which each type has at most one supertype and at most one
subtype.  Such a structure, called a "tower", is illustrated in *Note
Figure 2-25::.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 2.25:</b> A tower of types.
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orge47658a">
 complex
   ^
   |
  real
   ^
   |
rational
   ^
   |
integer
</pre>

<p>
   If we have a tower structure, then we can greatly simplify the
problem of adding a new type to the hierarchy, for we need only specify
how the new type is embedded in the next supertype above it and how it
is the supertype of the type below it.  For example, if we want to add
an integer to a complex number, we need not explicitly define a special
coercion procedure `integer-&gt;complex'.  Instead, we define how an
integer can be transformed into a rational number, how a rational
number is transformed into a real number, and how a real number is
transformed into a complex number.  We then allow the system to
transform the integer into a complex number through these steps and
then add the two complex numbers.
</p>

<p>
   We can redesign our `apply-generic' procedure in the following way:
For each type, we need to supply a `raise' procedure, which "raises"
objects of that type one level in the tower.  Then when the system is
required to operate on objects of different types it can successively
raise the lower types until all the objects are at the same level in
the tower.  (*Note Exercise 2-83:: and *Note Exercise 2-84:: concern
the details of implementing such a strategy.)
</p>

<p>
   Another advantage of a tower is that we can easily implement the
notion that every type "inherits" all operations defined on a
supertype.  For instance, if we do not supply a special procedure for
finding the real part of an integer, we should nevertheless expect that
`real-part' will be defined for integers by virtue of the fact that
integers are a subtype of complex numbers.  In a tower, we can arrange
for this to happen in a uniform way by modifying `apply-generic'.  If
the required operation is not directly defined for the type of the
object given, we raise the object to its supertype and try again.  We
thus crawl up the tower, transforming our argument as we go, until we
either find a level at which the desired operation can be performed or
hit the top (in which case we give up).
</p>

<p>
   Yet another advantage of a tower over a more general hierarchy is
that it gives us a simple way to "lower" a data object to the simplest
representation.  For example, if we add 2 + 3i to 4 - 3i, it would be
nice to obtain the answer as the integer 6 rather than as the complex
number 6 + 0i.  *Note Exercise 2-85:: discusses a way to implement such
a lowering operation.  (The trick is that we need a general way to
distinguish those objects that can be lowered, such as 6 + 0i, from
those that cannot, such as 6 + 2i.)

</p>

<p>
If the data types in our system can be naturally arranged in a tower,
this greatly simplifies the problems of dealing with generic operations
on different types, as we have seen.  Unfortunately, this is usually
not the case.  *Note Figure 2-26:: illustrates a more complex
arrangement of mixed types, this one showing relations among different
types of geometric figures.  We see that, in general, a type may have
more than one subtype.  Triangles and quadrilaterals, for instance, are
both subtypes of polygons.  In addition, a type may have more than one
supertype.  For example, an isosceles right triangle may be regarded
either as an isosceles triangle or as a right triangle.  This
multiple-supertypes issue is particularly thorny, since it means that
there is no unique way to "raise" a type in the hierarchy.  Finding the
"correct" supertype in which to apply an operation to an object may
involve considerable searching through the entire type network on the
part of a procedure such as `apply-generic'.  Since there generally are
multiple subtypes for a type, there is a similar problem in coercing a
value "down" the type hierarchy.  Dealing with large numbers of
interrelated types while still preserving modularity in the design of
large systems is very difficult, and is an area of much current
research.(4)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.81:</b> Louis Reasoner has noticed that `apply-generic'
may try to coerce the arguments to each other's type even if they
already have the same type.  Therefore, he reasons, we need to put
procedures in the coercion table to "coerce" arguments of each
type to their own type.  For example, in addition to the
`scheme-number-&gt;complex' coercion shown above, he would do:
</p>

<p>
(define (scheme-number-&gt;scheme-number n) n)
(define (complex-&gt;complex z) z)
(put-coercion 'scheme-number 'scheme-number
	      scheme-number-&gt;scheme-number)
(put-coercion 'complex 'complex complex-&gt;complex)
</p>

<p>
a. With Louis's coercion procedures installed, what happens if
   `apply-generic' is called with two arguments of type
   `scheme-number' or two arguments of type `complex' for an
   operation that is not found in the table for those types?
   For example, assume that we've defined a generic
   exponentiation operation:
</p>

<p>
(define (exp x y) (apply-generic 'exp x y))
</p>

<p>
and have put a procedure for exponentiation in the
Scheme-number package but not in any other package:
</p>

<p>
;; following added to Scheme-number package
(put 'exp '(scheme-number scheme-number)
     (lambda (x y) (tag (expt x y)))) ; using primitive `expt'
</p>

<p>
What happens if we call `exp' with two complex numbers as
arguments?
</p>

<p>
b. Is Louis correct that something had to be done about coercion
   with arguments of the same type, or does `apply-generic' work
   correctly as is?
</p>

<p>
c. Modify `apply-generic' so that it doesn't try coercion if the
   two arguments have the same type.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 2.82:</b> Show how to generalize `apply-generic' to handle
coercion in the general case of multiple arguments.  One strategy
is to attempt to coerce all the arguments to the type of the first

the two-argument version given above) is not sufficiently general.
(Hint: Consider the case where there are some suitable mixed-type
operations present in the table that will not be tried.)

<b>Exercise 2.83:</b> Suppose you are designing a generic arithmetic

way to test which of two types is higher in the tower.  Do this in
a manner that is "compatible" with the rest of the system and will
not lead to problems in adding new levels to the tower.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.85:</b> This section mentioned a method for "simplifying"
a data object by lowering it in the tower of types as far as
possible.  Design a procedure `drop' that accomplishes this for the
tower described in *Note Exercise 2-83::.  The key is to decide,
in some general way, whether an object can be lowered.  For
example, the complex number 1.5 + 0i can be lowered as far as
`real', the complex number 1 + 0i can be lowered as far as
`integer', and the complex number 2 + 3i cannot be lowered at all.
Here is a plan for determining whether an object can be lowered:
Begin by defining a generic operation `project' that "pushes" an
object down in the tower.  For example, projecting a complex
number would involve throwing away the imaginary part.  Then a
number can be dropped if, when we `project' it and `raise' the
result back to the type we started with, we end up with something
equal to what we started with.  Show how to implement this idea in
detail, by writing a `drop' procedure that drops an object as far
as possible.  You will need to design the various projection
operations(5) and install `project' as a generic operation in the
system.  You will also need to make use of a generic equality
predicate, such as described in *Note Exercise 2-79::.  Finally,
use `drop' to rewrite `apply-generic' from *Note Exercise 2-84::
so that it "simplifies" its answers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.86:</b> Suppose we want to handle complex numbers whose
real parts, imaginary parts, magnitudes, and angles can be either
ordinary numbers, rational numbers, or other numbers we might wish
to add to the system.  Describe and implement the changes to the
system needed to accommodate this.  You will have to define
operations such as `sine' and `cosine' that are generic over
ordinary numbers and rational numbers.

<p>
   (1) We also have to supply an almost identical procedure to handle
the types `(scheme-number complex)'.
</p>

<p>
(2) See *Note Exercise 2-82:: for generalizations.
</p>

<p>
   (3) If we are clever, we can usually get by with fewer than n<sup>2</sup>
coercion procedures.  For instance, if we know how to convert from type
1 to type 2 and from type 2 to type 3, then we can use this knowledge to
convert from type 1 to type 3.  This can greatly decrease the number of
coercion procedures we need to supply explicitly when we add a new type
to the system.  If we are willing to build the required amount of
sophistication into our system, we can have it search the "graph" of
relations among types and automatically generate those coercion
procedures that can be inferred from the ones that are supplied
explicitly.
</p>

<p>
   (4) This statement, which also appears in the first edition of this
book, is just as true now as it was when we wrote it twelve years ago.
Developing a useful, general framework for expressing the relations
among different types of entities (what philosophers call "ontology")
seems intractably difficult.  The main difference between the confusion
that existed ten years ago and the confusion that exists now is that
now a variety of inadequate ontological theories have been embodied in
a plethora of correspondingly inadequate programming languages.  For
example, much of the complexity of object-oriented programming
languages&#x2013;and the subtle and confusing differences among contemporary
object-oriented languages&#x2013;centers on the treatment of generic
operations on interrelated types.  Our own discussion of computational
objects in *Note Chapter 3:: avoids these issues entirely.  Readers
familiar with object-oriented programming will notice that we have much
to say in *Note Chapter 3:: about local state, but we do not even
mention "classes" or "inheritance."  In fact, we suspect that these
problems cannot be adequately addressed in terms of computer-language
design alone, without also drawing on work in knowledge representation
and automated reasoning.

primitive, which returns the closest integer to its argument.

<p>
The manipulation of symbolic algebraic expressions is a complex process
that illustrates many of the hardest problems that occur in the design
of large-scale systems.  An algebraic expression, in general, can be
viewed as a hierarchical structure, a tree of operators applied to
operands.  We can construct algebraic expressions by starting with a
set of primitive objects, such as constants and variables, and
combining these by means of algebraic operators, such as addition and
multiplication.  As in other languages, we form abstractions that
enable us to refer to compound objects in simple terms.  Typical
abstractions in symbolic algebra are ideas such as linear combination,
polynomial, rational function, or trigonometric function.  We can
regard these as compound "types," which are often useful for directing
the processing of expressions.  For example, we could describe the
expression
</p>

<p>
x<sup>2</sup> sin (y<sup>2</sup> + 1) + r cos 2y + cos(y<sup>3</sup> - 2y<sup>2</sup>)
</p>

<p>
as a polynomial in x with coefficients that are trigonometric functions
of polynomials in y whose coefficients are integers.
</p>

<p>
   We will not attempt to develop a complete algebraic-manipulation
system here.  Such systems are exceedingly complex programs, embodying
deep algebraic knowledge and elegant algorithms.  What we will do is
look at a simple but important part of algebraic manipulation: the
arithmetic of polynomials.  We will illustrate the kinds of decisions
the designer of such a system faces, and how to apply the ideas of
abstract data and generic operations to help organize this effort.
</p>

<p>
Arithmetic on polynomials
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Our first task in designing a system for performing arithmetic on
polynomials is to decide just what a polynomial is.  Polynomials are
normally defined relative to certain variables (the "indeterminates" of
the polynomial).  For simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to
polynomials having just one indeterminate ("univariate
polynomials").(1) We will define a polynomial to be a sum of terms,
each of which is either a coefficient, a power of the indeterminate, or
a product of a coefficient and a power of the indeterminate.  A
coefficient is defined as an algebraic expression that is not dependent
upon the indeterminate of the polynomial.  For example,
</p>

<p>
5x<sup>2</sup> + 3r + 7
</p>

<p>
is a simple polynomial in x, and
</p>

<p>
(y<sup>2</sup> + 1)r<sup>3</sup> + (2y)x + 1
</p>

<p>
is a polynomial in x whose coefficients are polynomials in y.
</p>

<p>
   Already we are skirting some thorny issues.  Is the first of these
polynomials the same as the polynomial 5y<sup>2</sup> + 3y + 7, or not?  A
reasonable answer might be "yes, if we are considering a polynomial
purely as a mathematical function, but no, if we are considering a
polynomial to be a syntactic form."  The second polynomial is
algebraically equivalent to a polynomial in y whose coefficients are
polynomials in x.  Should our system recognize this, or not?
Furthermore, there are other ways to represent a polynomial&#x2013;for
example, as a product of factors, or (for a univariate polynomial) as
the set of roots, or as a listing of the values of the polynomial at a
specified set of points.(2)  We can finesse these questions by deciding
that in our algebraic-manipulation system a "polynomial" will be a
particular syntactic form, not its underlying mathematical meaning.
</p>

<p>
   Now we must consider how to go about doing arithmetic on
polynomials.  In this simple system, we will consider only addition and
multiplication.  Moreover, we will insist that two polynomials to be
combined must have the same indeterminate.
</p>

<p>
   We will approach the design of our system by following the familiar
discipline of data abstraction.  We will represent polynomials using a
data structure called a "poly", which consists of a variable and a
collection of terms.  We assume that we have selectors `variable' and
`term-list' that extract those parts from a poly and a constructor
`make-poly' that assembles a poly from a given variable and a term
list.  A variable will be just a symbol, so we can use the
`same-variable?'  procedure of section *Note 2-3-2:: to compare
variables.  The following procedures define addition and multiplication
of polys:
</p>

<p>
(define (add-poly p1 p2)
  (if (same-variable? (variable p1) (variable p2))
      (make-poly (variable p1)
		 (add-terms (term-list p1)
			    (term-list p2)))
      (error "Polys not in same var &#x2013; ADD-POLY"
	     (list p1 p2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-poly p1 p2)
  (if (same-variable? (variable p1) (variable p2))
      (make-poly (variable p1)
		 (mul-terms (term-list p1)
			    (term-list p2)))
      (error "Polys not in same var &#x2013; MUL-POLY"
	     (list p1 p2))))
</p>

<p>
   To incorporate polynomials into our generic arithmetic system, we
need to supply them with type tags.  We'll use the tag `polynomial',
and install appropriate operations on tagged polynomials in the
operation table.  We'll embed all our code in an installation procedure
for the polynomial package, similar to the ones in section *Note
2-5-1:::
</p>

<p>
(define (install-polynomial-package)
  ;; internal procedures
  ;; representation of poly
  (define (make-poly variable term-list)
    (cons variable term-list))
  (define (variable p) (car p))
  (define (term-list p) (cdr p))
  &lt;<sub>procedures</sub> `same-variable?' and `variable?' from section 2.3.2_&gt;
</p>

<p>
;; representation of terms and term lists
&lt;<sub>procedures</sub> `adjoin-term' &#x2026; `coeff' from text below_&gt;
</p>

<p>
;; continued on next page
</p>

<p>
(define (add-poly p1 p2) &#x2026;)
&lt;<sub>procedures</sub> used by `add-poly'_&gt;
(define (mul-poly p1 p2) &#x2026;)
&lt;<sub>procedures</sub> used by `mul-poly'_&gt;
</p>

<p>
;; interface to rest of the system
(define (tag p) (attach-tag 'polynomial p))
(put 'add '(polynomial polynomial)
     (lambda (p1 p2) (tag (add-poly p1 p2))))
(put 'mul '(polynomial polynomial)
     (lambda (p1 p2) (tag (mul-poly p1 p2))))
(put 'make 'polynomial
     (lambda (var terms) (tag (make-poly var terms))))
'done)
</p>

<p>
   Polynomial addition is performed termwise.  Terms of the same order
(i.e., with the same power of the indeterminate) must be combined.
This is done by forming a new term of the same order whose coefficient
is the sum of the coefficients of the addends.  Terms in one addend for
which there are no terms of the same order in the other addend are
simply accumulated into the sum polynomial being constructed.
</p>

<p>
   In order to manipulate term lists, we will assume that we have a
constructor `the-empty-termlist' that returns an empty term list and a
constructor `adjoin-term' that adjoins a new term to a term list.  We
will also assume that we have a predicate `empty-termlist?' that tells
if a given term list is empty, a selector `first-term' that extracts
the highest-order term from a term list, and a selector `rest-terms'
that returns all but the highest-order term.  To manipulate terms, we
will suppose that we have a constructor `make-term' that constructs a
term with given order and coefficient, and selectors `order' and
`coeff' that return, respectively, the order and the coefficient of the
term.  These operations allow us to consider both terms and term lists
as data abstractions, whose concrete representations we can worry about
separately.
</p>

<p>
   Here is the procedure that constructs the term list for the sum of
two polynomials:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (add-terms L1 L2)
  (cond ((empty-termlist? L1) L2)
	((empty-termlist? L2) L1)
	(else
	 (let ((t1 (first-term L1)) (t2 (first-term L2)))
	   (cond ((&gt; (order t1) (order t2))
		  (adjoin-term
		   t1 (add-terms (rest-terms L1) L2)))
		 ((&lt; (order t1) (order t2))
		  (adjoin-term
		   t2 (add-terms L1 (rest-terms L2))))
		 (else
		  (adjoin-term
		   (make-term (order t1)
			      (add (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
		   (add-terms (rest-terms L1)
			      (rest-terms L2)))))))))
</p>

<p>
   The most important point to note here is that we used the generic
addition procedure `add' to add together the coefficients of the terms
being combined.  This has powerful consequences, as we will see below.
</p>

<p>
   In order to multiply two term lists, we multiply each term of the
first list by all the terms of the other list, repeatedly using
`mul-term-by-all-terms', which multiplies a given term by all terms in
a given term list.  The resulting term lists (one for each term of the
first list) are accumulated into a sum.  Multiplying two terms forms a
term whose order is the sum of the orders of the factors and whose
coefficient is the product of the coefficients of the factors:
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-terms L1 L2)
  (if (empty-termlist? L1)
      (the-empty-termlist)
      (add-terms (mul-term-by-all-terms (first-term L1) L2)
		 (mul-terms (rest-terms L1) L2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (mul-term-by-all-terms t1 L)
  (if (empty-termlist? L)
      (the-empty-termlist)
      (let ((t2 (first-term L)))
	(adjoin-term
	 (make-term (+ (order t1) (order t2))
		    (mul (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
	 (mul-term-by-all-terms t1 (rest-terms L))))))
</p>

<p>
   This is really all there is to polynomial addition and
multiplication.  Notice that, since we operate on terms using the
generic procedures `add' and `mul', our polynomial package is
automatically able to handle any type of coefficient that is known
about by the generic arithmetic package.  If we include a coercion
mechanism such as one of those discussed in section *Note 2-5-2::, then
we also are automatically able to handle operations on polynomials of
different coefficient types, such as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org80007f3">

                         /        2                 \
[3x^2 + (2 + 3i)x + 7] * | x^4 + --- x^2 + (5 + 3i) |
                         \        3                 /
</pre>

<p>
Because we installed the polynomial addition and multiplication
procedures `add-poly' and `mul-poly' in the generic arithmetic system
as the `add' and `mul' operations for type `polynomial', our system is
also automatically able to handle polynomial operations such as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbd21604">
[(y + 1)x^2 + (y^2 + 1)x + (y - 1)] * [(y - 2)x + (y^3 + 7)]
</pre>

<p>
The reason is that when the system tries to combine coefficients, it
will dispatch through `add' and `mul'.  Since the coefficients are
themselves polynomials (in y), these will be combined using `add-poly'
and `mul-poly'.  The result is a kind of "data-directed recursion" in
which, for example, a call to `mul-poly' will result in recursive calls
to `mul-poly' in order to multiply the coefficients.  If the
coefficients of the coefficients were themselves polynomials (as might
be used to represent polynomials in three variables), the data
direction would ensure that the system would follow through another
level of recursive calls, and so on through as many levels as the
structure of the data dictates.(4)
</p>

<p>
Representing term lists
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Finally, we must confront the job of implementing a good representation
for term lists.  A term list is, in effect, a set of coefficients keyed
by the order of the term.  Hence, any of the methods for representing
sets, as discussed in section *Note 2-3-3::, can be applied to this
task.  On the other hand, our procedures `add-terms' and `mul-terms'
always access term lists sequentially from highest to lowest order.
Thus, we will use some kind of ordered list representation.
</p>

<p>
   How should we structure the list that represents a term list?  One
consideration is the "density" of the polynomials we intend to
manipulate.  A polynomial is said to be "dense" if it has nonzero
coefficients in terms of most orders.  If it has many zero terms it is
said to be "sparse".  For example,
</p>

<p>
A : x<sup>5</sup> + 2x<sup>4</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x - 5
</p>

<p>
is a dense polynomial, whereas
</p>

<p>
B : x<sup>100</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 1
</p>

<p>
is sparse.
</p>

<p>
   The term lists of dense polynomials are most efficiently represented
as lists of the coefficients.  For example, A above would be nicely
represented as `(1 2 0 3 -2 -5)'.  The order of a term in this
representation is the length of the sublist beginning with that term's
coefficient, decremented by 1.(5)  This would be a terrible
representation for a sparse polynomial such as B: There would be a
giant list of zeros punctuated by a few lonely nonzero terms.  A more
reasonable representation of the term list of a sparse polynomial is as
a list of the nonzero terms, where each term is a list containing the
order of the term and the coefficient for that order.  In such a
scheme, polynomial B is efficiently represented as `((100 1) (2 2) (0
1))'.  As most polynomial manipulations are performed on sparse
polynomials, we will use this method.  We will assume that term lists
are represented as lists of terms, arranged from highest-order to
lowest-order term.  Once we have made this decision, implementing the
selectors and constructors for terms and term lists is
straightforward:(6)
</p>

<p>
(define (adjoin-term term term-list)
  (if (=zero? (coeff term))
      term-list
      (cons term term-list)))
</p>

<p>
(define (the-empty-termlist) '())
(define (first-term term-list) (car term-list))
(define (rest-terms term-list) (cdr term-list))
(define (empty-termlist? term-list) (null? term-list))

</p>

<p>
where `=zero?' is as defined in *Note Exercise 2-80::.  (See also *Note
Exercise 2-87:: below.)
</p>

<p>
   Users of the polynomial package will create (tagged) polynomials by
means of the procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-polynomial var terms)
  ((get 'make 'polynomial) var terms))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.87:</b> Install `=zero?' for polynomials in the generic
arithmetic package.  This will allow `adjoin-term' to work for
polynomials with coefficients that are themselves polynomials.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.88:</b> Extend the polynomial system to include
subtraction of polynomials.  (Hint: You may find it helpful to
define a generic negation operation.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.89:</b> Define procedures that implement the term-list
representation described above as appropriate for dense
polynomials.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.90:</b> Suppose we want to have a polynomial system that
is efficient for both sparse and dense polynomials.  One way to do
this is to allow both kinds of term-list representations in our
system.  The situation is analogous to the complex-number example
of section *Note 2-4::, where we allowed both rectangular and
polar representations.  To do this we must distinguish different
types of term lists and make the operations on term lists generic.
Redesign the polynomial system to implement this generalization.
This is a major effort, not a local change.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.91:</b> A univariate polynomial can be divided by another
one to produce a polynomial quotient and a polynomial remainder.
For example,
</p>

<p>
x<sup>5</sup> - 1
--&#x2013;&#x2014; = x<sup>3</sup> + x, remainder x - 1
x<sup>2</sup> - 1
</p>

<p>
Division can be performed via long division.  That is, divide the
highest-order term of the dividend by the highest-order term of
the divisor.  The result is the first term of the quotient.  Next,
multiply the result by the divisor, subtract that from the
dividend, and produce the rest of the answer by recursively
dividing the difference by the divisor.  Stop when the order of the
divisor exceeds the order of the dividend and declare the dividend
to be the remainder.  Also, if the dividend ever becomes zero,
return zero as both quotient and remainder.
</p>

<p>
We can design a `div-poly' procedure on the model of `add-poly' and
`mul-poly'. The procedure checks to see if the two polys have the
same variable.  If so, `div-poly' strips off the variable and
passes the problem to `div-terms', which performs the division
operation on term lists. `Div-poly' finally reattaches the
variable to the result supplied by `div-terms'.  It is convenient
to design `div-terms' to compute both the quotient and the
remainder of a division.  `Div-terms' can take two term lists as
arguments and return a list of the quotient term list and the
remainder term list.
</p>

<p>
Complete the following definition of `div-terms' by filling in the
missing expressions.  Use this to implement `div-poly', which
takes two polys as arguments and returns a list of the quotient
and remainder polys.
</p>

<p>
(define (div-terms L1 L2)
  (if (empty-termlist? L1)
      (list (the-empty-termlist) (the-empty-termlist))
      (let ((t1 (first-term L1))
	    (t2 (first-term L2)))
	(if (&gt; (order t2) (order t1))
	    (list (the-empty-termlist) L1)
	    (let ((new-c (div (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
		  (new-o (- (order t1) (order t2))))
	      (let ((rest-of-result
		     &lt;COMPUTE REST OF RESULT RECURSIVELY&gt;
		     ))
		&lt;FORM COMPLETE RESULT&gt;
		))))))

Hierarchies of types in symbolic algebra

</p>

<p>
Our polynomial system illustrates how objects of one type (polynomials)
may in fact be complex objects that have objects of many different
types as parts.  This poses no real difficulty in defining generic
operations.  We need only install appropriate generic operations for
performing the necessary manipulations of the parts of the compound
types.  In fact, we saw that polynomials form a kind of "recursive data
abstraction," in that parts of a polynomial may themselves be
polynomials.  Our generic operations and our data-directed programming
style can handle this complication without much trouble.
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, polynomial algebra is a system for which the data
types cannot be naturally arranged in a tower.  For instance, it is
possible to have polynomials in x whose coefficients are polynomials in
y.  It is also possible to have polynomials in y whose coefficients are
polynomials in x.  Neither of these types is "above" the other in any
natural way, yet it is often necessary to add together elements from
each set.  There are several ways to do this.  One possibility is to
convert one polynomial to the type of the other by expanding and
rearranging terms so that both polynomials have the same principal
variable.  One can impose a towerlike structure on this by ordering the
variables and thus always converting any polynomial to a "canonical
form" with the highest-priority variable dominant and the
lower-priority variables buried in the coefficients.  This strategy
works fairly well, except that the conversion may expand a polynomial
unnecessarily, making it hard to read and perhaps less efficient to
work with.  The tower strategy is certainly not natural for this domain
or for any domain where the user can invent new types dynamically using
old types in various combining forms, such as trigonometric functions,
power series, and integrals.
</p>

<p>
   It should not be surprising that controlling coercion is a serious
problem in the design of large-scale algebraic-manipulation systems.
Much of the complexity of such systems is concerned with relationships
among diverse types.  Indeed, it is fair to say that we do not yet
completely understand coercion.  In fact, we do not yet completely
understand the concept of a data type.  Nevertheless, what we know
provides us with powerful structuring and modularity principles to
support the design of large systems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.92:</b> By imposing an ordering on variables, extend the
polynomial package so that addition and multiplication of
polynomials works for polynomials in different variables.  (This
is not easy!)
</p>

<p>
Extended exercise: Rational functions

</p>

<p>
We can extend our generic arithmetic system to include functions
"rational functions".  These are "fractions" whose numerator and
denominator are polynomials, such as
</p>

<p>
x + 1
</p>
<hr />
<p>
x<sup>3</sup> - 1
</p>

<p>
   The system should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide
rational functions, and to perform such computations as
</p>

<p>
 x + 1       x      x<sup>3</sup> + 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x + 1
--&#x2013;&#x2014; + --&#x2013;&#x2014; = --------------&#x2013;&#x2014;
x<sup>3</sup> - 1   x<sup>2</sup> - 1    x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> - x - 1
</p>

<p>
(Here the sum has been simplified by removing common factors.  Ordinary
"cross multiplication" would have produced a fourth-degree polynomial
over a fifth-degree polynomial.)
</p>

<p>
   If we modify our rational-arithmetic package so that it uses generic
operations, then it will do what we want, except for the problem of
reducing fractions to lowest terms.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.93:</b> Modify the rational-arithmetic package to use
generic operations, but change `make-rat' so that it does not
attempt to reduce fractions to lowest terms.  Test your system by
calling `make-rational' on two polynomials to produce a rational
function
</p>

<p>
(define p1 (make-polynomial 'x '((2 1)(0 1))))
(define p2 (make-polynomial 'x '((3 1)(0 1))))
(define rf (make-rational p2 p1))
</p>

<p>
Now add `rf' to itself, using `add'. You will observe that this
addition procedure does not reduce fractions to lowest terms.
</p>

<p>
We can reduce polynomial fractions to lowest terms using the same
idea we used with integers: modifying `make-rat' to divide both
the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common
divisor.  The notion of "greatest common divisor" makes sense for
polynomials.  In fact, we can compute the GCD of two polynomials
using essentially the same Euclid's Algorithm that works for
integers.(7)  The integer version is
</p>

<p>
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
</p>

<p>
Using this, we could make the obvious modification to define a GCD
operation that works on term lists:
</p>

<p>
(define (gcd-terms a b)
  (if (empty-termlist? b)
      a
      (gcd-terms b (remainder-terms a b))))
</p>

<p>
where `remainder-terms' picks out the remainder component of the
list returned by the term-list division operation `div-terms' that
was implemented in *Note Exercise 2-91::.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.94:</b> Using `div-terms', implement the procedure
`remainder-terms' and use this to define `gcd-terms' as above.
Now write a procedure `gcd-poly' that computes the polynomial GCD
of two polys.  (The procedure should signal an error if the two
polys are not in the same variable.)  Install in the system a
generic operation `greatest-common-divisor' that reduces to
`gcd-poly' for polynomials and to ordinary `gcd' for ordinary
numbers.  As a test, try
</p>

<p>
(define p1 (make-polynomial 'x '((4 1) (3 -1) (2 -2) (1 2))))
(define p2 (make-polynomial 'x '((3 1) (1 -1))))
(greatest-common-divisor p1 p2)
</p>

<p>
and check your result by hand.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.95:</b> Define P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub> to be the polynomials
</p>

<p>
P<sub>1</sub> : x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + 1
</p>

<p>
P<sub>2</sub> : 11x<sup>2</sup> + 7
</p>

<p>
P<sub>3</sub> : 13x + 5
</p>

<p>
Now define Q<sub>1</sub> to be the product of P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> to be the
product of P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>3</sub>, and use `greatest-common-divisor' (*Note
Exercise 2-94::) to compute the GCD of Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>.  Note that the
answer is not the same as P<sub>1</sub>.  This example introduces noninteger
operations into the computation, causing difficulties with the GCD
algorithm.(8)  To understand what is happening, try tracing
`gcd-terms' while computing the GCD or try performing the division
by hand.
</p>

<p>
We can solve the problem exhibited in *Note Exercise 2-95:: if we
use the following modification of the GCD algorithm (which really
works only in the case of polynomials with integer coefficients).
Before performing any polynomial division in the GCD computation,
we multiply the dividend by an integer constant factor, chosen to
guarantee that no fractions will arise during the division
process.  Our answer will thus differ from the actual GCD by an
integer constant factor, but this does not matter in the case of
reducing rational functions to lowest terms; the GCD will be used
to divide both the numerator and denominator, so the integer
constant factor will cancel out.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, if P and Q are polynomials, let O<sub>1</sub> be the order of
P (i.e., the order of the largest term of P) and let O<sub>2</sub> be the
order of Q.  Let c be the leading coefficient of Q.  Then it can be
shown that, if we multiply P by the "integerizing factor" c<sup>(1+O<sub>1</sub>
-O<sub>2</sub>)</sup>, the resulting polynomial can be divided by Q by using the
`div-terms' algorithm without introducing any fractions.  The
operation of multiplying the dividend by this constant and then
dividing is sometimes called the "pseudodivision" of P by Q.  The
remainder of the division is called the "pseudoremainder".
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2.96:</b>
  a. Implement the procedure `pseudoremainder-terms', which is
     just like `remainder-terms' except that it multiplies the
     dividend by the integerizing factor described above before
     calling `div-terms'.  Modify `gcd-terms' to use
     `pseudoremainder-terms', and verify that
     `greatest-common-divisor' now produces an answer with integer
     coefficients on the example in *Note Exercise 2-95::.
</p>

<p>
b. The GCD now has integer coefficients, but they are larger
   than those of P<sub>1</sub>.  Modify `gcd-terms' so that it removes
   common factors from the coefficients of the answer by
   dividing all the coefficients by their (integer) greatest
   common divisor.
</p>


<p>
Thus, here is how to reduce a rational function to lowest terms:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Compute the GCD of the numerator and denominator, using the
version of `gcd-terms' from *Note Exercise 2-96::.</li>

<li><p>
When you obtain the GCD, multiply both numerator and
denominator by the same integerizing factor before dividing
through by the GCD, so that division by the GCD will not
introduce any noninteger coefficients.  As the factor you can
use the leading coefficient of the GCD raised to the power 1
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>O<sub>1</sub> - O<sub>2</sub>, where O<sub>2</sub> is the order of the GCD and O<sub>1</sub> is the</li>
</ul>
<p>
maximum of the orders of the numerator and denominator.  This
will ensure that dividing the numerator and denominator by
the GCD will not introduce any fractions.
</p></li>

<li>The result of this operation will be a numerator and
denominator with integer coefficients.  The coefficients will
normally be very large because of all of the integerizing
factors, so the last step is to remove the redundant factors
by computing the (integer) greatest common divisor of all the
coefficients of the numerator and the denominator and
dividing through by this factor.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Exercise 2.97:</b>
  a. Implement this algorithm as a procedure `reduce-terms' that
     takes two term lists `n' and `d' as arguments and returns a
     list `nn', `dd', which are `n' and `d' reduced to lowest
     terms via the algorithm given above.  Also write a procedure
     `reduce-poly', analogous to `add-poly', that checks to see if
     the two polys have the same variable.  If so, `reduce-poly'
     strips off the variable and passes the problem to
     `reduce-terms', then reattaches the variable to the two term
     lists supplied by `reduce-terms'.
</p>

<p>
b. Define a procedure analogous to `reduce-terms' that does what
   the original `make-rat' did for integers:
</p>

<p>
(define (reduce-integers n d)
  (let ((g (gcd n d)))
    (list (/ n g) (/ d g))))
</p>

<p>
and define `reduce' as a generic operation that calls
`apply-generic' to dispatch to either `reduce-poly' (for
`polynomial' arguments) or `reduce-integers' (for
`scheme-number' arguments).  You can now easily make the
rational-arithmetic package reduce fractions to lowest terms
by having `make-rat' call `reduce' before combining the given
numerator and denominator to form a rational number.  The
system now handles rational expressions in either integers or
polynomials.  To test your program, try the example at the
beginning of this extended exercise:
</p>

<p>
(define p1 (make-polynomial 'x '((1 1)(0 1))))
(define p2 (make-polynomial 'x '((3 1)(0 -1))))
(define p3 (make-polynomial 'x '((1 1))))
(define p4 (make-polynomial 'x '((2 1)(0 -1))))
</p>

<p>
(define rf1 (make-rational p1 p2))
(define rf2 (make-rational p3 p4))
</p>

<p>
(add rf1 rf2)
</p>

<p>
See if you get the correct answer, correctly reduced to
lowest terms.
</p>

<p>
The GCD computation is at the heart of any system that does
operations on rational functions.  The algorithm used above,
although mathematically straightforward, is extremely slow.
The slowness is due partly to the large number of division
operations and partly to the enormous size of the
intermediate coefficients generated by the pseudodivisions.
One of the active areas in the development of
algebraic-manipulation systems is the design of better
algorithms for computing polynomial GCDs.(9)

   (1) On the other hand, we will allow polynomials whose coefficients
are themselves polynomials in other variables.  This will give us
essentially the same representational power as a full multivariate
system, although it does lead to coercion problems, as discussed below.
</p>

<p>
   (2) For univariate polynomials, giving the value of a polynomial at
a given set of points can be a particularly good representation.  This
makes polynomial arithmetic extremely simple.  To obtain, for example,
the sum of two polynomials represented in this way, we need only add
the values of the polynomials at corresponding points.  To transform
back to a more familiar representation, we can use the Lagrange
interpolation formula, which shows how to recover the coefficients of a
polynomial of degree n given the values of the polynomial at n + 1
points.
</p>

<p>
   (3) This operation is very much like the ordered `union-set'
operation we developed in exercise *Note Exercise 2-62::.  In fact, if
we think of the terms of the polynomial as a set ordered according to
the power of the indeterminate, then the program that produces the term
list for a sum is almost identical to `union-set'.
</p>

<p>
   (4) To make this work completely smoothly, we should also add to our
generic arithmetic system the ability to coerce a "number" to a
polynomial by regarding it as a polynomial of degree zero whose
coefficient is the number.  This is necessary if we are going to
perform operations such as
</p>

<p>
[x<sup>2</sup> + (y + 1)x + 5] + [x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1]
</p>

<p>
which requires adding the coefficient y + 1 to the coefficient 2.
</p>

<p>
   (5) In these polynomial examples, we assume that we have implemented
the generic arithmetic system using the type mechanism suggested in
*Note Exercise 2-78::.  Thus, coefficients that are ordinary numbers
will be represented as the numbers themselves rather than as pairs
whose `car' is the symbol `scheme-number'.
</p>

<p>
   (6) Although we are assuming that term lists are ordered, we have
implemented `adjoin-term' to simply `cons' the new term onto the
existing term list.  We can get away with this so long as we guarantee
that the procedures (such as `add-terms') that use `adjoin-term' always
call it with a higher-order term than appears in the list.  If we did
not want to make such a guarantee, we could have implemented
`adjoin-term' to be similar to the `adjoin-set' constructor for the
ordered-list representation of sets (*Note Exercise 2-61::).
</p>

<p>
   (7) The fact that Euclid's Algorithm works for polynomials is
formalized in algebra by saying that polynomials form a kind of
algebraic domain called a "Euclidean ring".  A Euclidean ring is a
domain that admits addition, subtraction, and commutative
multiplication, together with a way of assigning to each element x of
the ring a positive integer "measure" m(x) with the properties that
m(xy)&gt;= m(x) for any nonzero x and y and that, given any x and y, there
exists a q such that y = qx + r and either r = 0 or m(r)&lt; m(x).  From
an abstract point of view, this is what is needed to prove that
Euclid's Algorithm works.  For the domain of integers, the measure m of
an integer is the absolute value of the integer itself.  For the domain
of polynomials, the measure of a polynomial is its degree.
</p>

<p>
   (8) In an implementation like MIT Scheme, this produces a polynomial
that is indeed a divisor of Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, but with rational
coefficients.  In many other Scheme systems, in which division of
integers can produce limited-precision decimal numbers, we may fail to
get a valid divisor.
</p>

<p>
   (9) One extremely efficient and elegant method for computing
polynomial GCDs was discovered by Richard Zippel (1979).  The method is
a probabilistic algorithm, as is the fast test for primality that we
discussed in *Note Chapter 1::.  Zippel's book (1993) describes this
method, together with other ways to compute polynomial GCDs.

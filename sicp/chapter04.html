   In our study of program design, we have seen that expert programmers
control the complexity of their designs with the same general
techniques used by designers of all complex systems.  They combine
primitive elements to form compound objects, they abstract compound
objects to form higher-level building blocks, and they preserve
modularity by adopting appropriate large-scale views of system
structure.  In illustrating these techniques, we have used Lisp as a
language for describing processes and for constructing computational
data objects and processes to model complex phenomena in the real
world.  However, as we confront increasingly complex problems, we will
find that Lisp, or indeed any fixed programming language, is not
sufficient for our needs.  We must constantly turn to new languages in
order to express our ideas more effectively.  Establishing new
languages is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in
engineering design; we can often enhance our ability to deal with a
complex problem by adopting a new language that enables us to describe
(and hence to think about) the problem in a different way, using
primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction that are
particularly well suited to the problem at hand.(1)
</p>

<p>
   Programming is endowed with a multitude of languages.  There are
physical languages, such as the machine languages for particular
computers.  These languages are concerned with the representation of
data and control in terms of individual bits of storage and primitive
machine instructions.  The machine-language programmer is concerned
with using the given hardware to erect systems and utilities for the
efficient implementation of resource-limited computations.  High-level
languages, erected on a machine-language substrate, hide concerns about
the representation of data as collections of bits and the
representation of programs as sequences of primitive instructions.
These languages have means of combination and abstraction, such as
procedure definition, that are appropriate to the larger-scale
organization of systems.
</p>

<p>
   "Metalinguistic abstraction"&#x2013;establishing new languages&#x2013;plays an
important role in all branches of engineering design.  It is
particularly important to computer programming, because in programming
not only can we formulate new languages but we can also implement these
languages by constructing evaluators.  An "evaluator" (or "interpreter")
for a programming language is a procedure that, when applied to an
expression of the language, performs the actions required to evaluate
that expression.
</p>

<p>
   It is no exaggeration to regard this as the most fundamental idea in
programming:
</p>

<p>
The evaluator, which determines the meaning of expressions in a
programming language, is just another program.
</p>

<p>
   To appreciate this point is to change our images of ourselves as
programmers.  We come to see ourselves as designers of languages,
rather than only users of languages designed by others.
</p>

<p>
   In fact, we can regard almost any program as the evaluator for some
language.  For instance, the polynomial manipulation system of section
*Note 2-5-3:: embodies the rules of polynomial arithmetic and
implements them in terms of operations on list-structured data.  If we
augment this system with procedures to read and print polynomial
expressions, we have the core of a special-purpose language for dealing
with problems in symbolic mathematics.  The digital-logic simulator of
section *Note 3-3-4:: and the constraint propagator of section *Note
3-3-5:: are legitimate languages in their own right, each with its own
primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction.  Seen from
this perspective, the technology for coping with large-scale computer
systems merges with the technology for building new computer languages,
and computer science itself becomes no more (and no less) than the
discipline of constructing appropriate descriptive languages.
</p>

<p>
   We now embark on a tour of the technology by which languages are
established in terms of other languages.  In this chapter we shall use
Lisp as a base, implementing evaluators as Lisp procedures.  Lisp is
particularly well suited to this task, because of its ability to
represent and manipulate symbolic expressions.  We will take the first
step in understanding how languages are implemented by building an
evaluator for Lisp itself.  The language implemented by our evaluator
will be a subset of the Scheme dialect of Lisp that we use in this
book.  Although the evaluator described in this chapter is written for a
particular dialect of Lisp, it contains the essential structure of an
evaluator for any expression-oriented language designed for writing
programs for a sequential machine.  (In fact, most language processors
contain, deep within them, a little "Lisp" evaluator.)  The evaluator
has been simplified for the purposes of illustration and discussion,
and some features have been left out that would be important to include
in a production-quality Lisp system.  Nevertheless, this simple
evaluator is adequate to execute most of the programs in this book.(2)
</p>

<p>
   An important advantage of making the evaluator accessible as a Lisp
program is that we can implement alternative evaluation rules by
describing these as modifications to the evaluator program.  One place
where we can use this power to good effect is to gain extra control
over the ways in which computational models embody the notion of time,
which was so central to the discussion in *Note Chapter 3::.  There, we
mitigated some of the complexities of state and assignment by using
streams to decouple the representation of time in the world from time
in the computer.  Our stream programs, however, were sometimes
cumbersome, because they were constrained by the applicative-order
evaluation of Scheme.  In section *Note 4-2::, we'll change the
underlying language to provide for a more elegant approach, by
modifying the evaluator to provide for "normal-order evaluation".
</p>

<p>
   Section *Note 4-3:: implements a more ambitious linguistic change,
whereby expressions have many values, rather than just a single value.
In this language of "nondeterministic computing", it is natural to
express processes that generate all possible values for expressions and
then search for those values that satisfy certain constraints.  In
terms of models of computation and time, this is like having time
branch into a set of "possible futures" and then searching for
appropriate time lines.  With our nondeterministic evaluator, keeping
track of multiple values and performing searches are handled
automatically by the underlying mechanism of the language.
</p>

<p>
   In section *Note 4-4:: we implement a "logic-programming" language in
which knowledge is expressed in terms of relations, rather than in
terms of computations with inputs and outputs.  Even though this makes
the language drastically different from Lisp, or indeed from any
conventional language, we will see that the logic-programming evaluator
shares the essential structure of the Lisp evaluator.

   (1) The same idea is pervasive throughout all of engineering.  For
example, electrical engineers use many different languages for
describing circuits.  Two of these are the language of electrical "networks"
and the language of electrical "systems".  The network language
emphasizes the physical modeling of devices in terms of discrete
electrical elements.  The primitive objects of the network language are
primitive electrical components such as resistors, capacitors,
inductors, and transistors, which are characterized in terms of
physical variables called voltage and current.  When describing
circuits in the network language, the engineer is concerned with the
physical characteristics of a design.  In contrast, the primitive
objects of the system language are signal-processing modules such as
filters and amplifiers.  Only the functional behavior of the modules is
relevant, and signals are manipulated without concern for their
physical realization as voltages and currents.  The system language is
erected on the network language, in the sense that the elements of
signal-processing systems are constructed from electrical networks.
Here, however, the concerns are with the large-scale organization of
electrical devices to solve a given application problem; the physical
feasibility of the parts is assumed.  This layered collection of
languages is another example of the stratified design technique
illustrated by the picture language of section *Note 2-2-4::.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The most important features that our evaluator leaves out are
mechanisms for handling errors and supporting debugging.  For a more
extensive discussion of evaluators, see Friedman, Wand, and Haynes
1992, which gives an exposition of programming languages that proceeds
via a sequence of evaluators written in Scheme.

<h2 id="org365330c"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> The Metacircular Evaluator</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Our evaluator for Lisp will be implemented as a Lisp program.  It may
seem circular to think about evaluating Lisp programs using an
evaluator that is itself implemented in Lisp.  However, evaluation is a
process, so it is appropriate to describe the evaluation process using
Lisp, which, after all, is our tool for describing processes.(1) An
evaluator that is written in the same language that it evaluates is
said to be "metacircular".
</p>

<p>
   The metacircular evaluator is essentially a Scheme formulation of the
environment model of evaluation described in section *Note 3-2::.
Recall that the model has two basic parts:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>To evaluate a combination (a compound expression other than a
special form), evaluate the subexpressions and then apply the
value of the operator subexpression to the values of the operand
subexpressions.</li>

<li>To apply a compound procedure to a set of arguments, evaluate the
body of the procedure in a new environment.  To construct this
environment, extend the environment part of the procedure object
by a frame in which the formal parameters of the procedure are
bound to the arguments to which the procedure is applied.</li>
</ol>


<p>
   These two rules describe the essence of the evaluation process, a
basic cycle in which expressions to be evaluated in environments are
reduced to procedures to be applied to arguments, which in turn are
reduced to new expressions to be evaluated in new environments, and so
on, until we get down to symbols, whose values are looked up in the
environment, and to primitive procedures, which are applied directly
(see *Note Figure 4-1::).(2) This evaluation cycle will be embodied by
the interplay between the two critical procedures in the evaluator,
`eval' and `apply', which are described in section *Note 4-1-1:: (see
*Note Figure 4-1::).
</p>

<p>
   The implementation of the evaluator will depend upon procedures that
define the "syntax" of the expressions to be evaluated.  We will use
data abstraction to make the evaluator independent of the
representation of the language.  For example, rather than committing to
a choice that an assignment is to be represented by a list beginning
with the symbol `set!' we use an abstract predicate `assignment?' to
test for an assignment, and we use abstract selectors
`assignment-variable' and `assignment-value' to access the parts of an
assignment.  Implementation of expressions will be described in detail
in section *Note 4-1-2::.  There are also operations, described in
section *Note 4-1-3::, that specify the representation of procedures
and environments.  For example, `make-procedure' constructs compound
procedures, `lookup-variable-value' accesses the values of variables,
and `apply-primitive-procedure' applies a primitive procedure to a
given list of arguments.
</p>


<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Even so, there will remain important aspects of the evaluation
process that are not elucidated by our evaluator.  The most important
of these are the detailed mechanisms by which procedures call other
procedures and return values to their callers.  We will address these
issues in *Note Chapter 5::, where we take a closer look at the
evaluation process by implementing the evaluator as a simple register
machine.
</p>

<p>
   (2) If we grant ourselves the ability to apply primitives, then what
remains for us to implement in the evaluator?  The job of the evaluator
is not to specify the primitives of the language, but rather to provide
the connective tissue&#x2013;the means of combination and the means of
abstraction&#x2013;that binds a collection of primitives to form a language.
Specifically:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The evaluator enables us to deal with nested expressions.  For
example, although simply applying primitives would suffice for
evaluating the expression `(+ 1 6)', it is not adequate for
handling `(+ 1 (* 2 3))'.  As far as the primitive procedure `+'
is concerned, its arguments must be numbers, and it would choke if
we passed it the expression `(* 2 3)' as an argument.  One
important role of the evaluator is to choreograph procedure
composition so that `(* 2 3)' is reduced to 6 before being passed
as an argument to `+'.</li>

<li>The evaluator allows us to use variables.  For example, the
primitive procedure for addition has no way to deal with
expressions such as `(+ x 1)'.  We need an evaluator to keep track
of variables and obtain their values before invoking the primitive
procedures.</li>

<li>The evaluator allows us to define compound procedures.  This
involves keeping track of procedure definitions, knowing how to
use these definitions in evaluating expressions, and providing a
mechanism that enables procedures to accept arguments.</li>

<li>The evaluator provides the special forms, which must be evaluated
differently from procedure calls.</li>

<p>
[graphic by Normand Veillux, modified]
</p>

<p>
The evaluation process can be described as the interplay between two
procedures: `eval' and `apply'.
</p>

<p>
Eval
&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
`Eval' takes as arguments an expression and an environment.  It
classifies the expression and directs its evaluation.  `Eval' is
structured as a case analysis of the syntactic type of the expression
to be evaluated.  In order to keep the procedure general, we express
the determination of the type of an expression abstractly, making no
commitment to any particular representation for the various types of
expressions.  Each type of expression has a predicate that tests for it
and an abstract means for selecting its parts.  This "abstract syntax"
makes it easy to see how we can change the syntax of the language by
using the same evaluator, but with a different collection of syntax
procedures.
</p>

<p>
Primitive expressions
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For self-evaluating expressions, such as numbers, `eval' returns
the expression itself.</li>

<li>`Eval' must look up variables in the environment to find their
values.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Special forms
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For quoted expressions, `eval' returns the expression that was
quoted.</li>

<li>An assignment to (or a definition of) a variable must recursively
call `eval' to compute the new value to be associated with the
variable.  The environment must be modified to change (or create)
the binding of the variable.</li>

<li>An `if' expression requires special processing of its parts, so as
to evaluate the consequent if the predicate is true, and otherwise
to evaluate the alternative.</li>

<li>A `lambda' expression must be transformed into an applicable
procedure by packaging together the parameters and body specified
by the `lambda' expression with the environment of the evaluation.</li>

<li>A `begin' expression requires evaluating its sequence of
expressions in the order in which they appear.</li>

<li>A case analysis (`cond') is transformed into a nest of `if'
expressions and then evaluated.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Combinations
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For a procedure application, `eval' must recursively evaluate the
operator part and the operands of the combination.  The resulting
procedure and arguments are passed to `apply', which handles the
actual procedure application.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Here is the definition of `eval':
</p>

<p>
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
	((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
	((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))
	((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))
	((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
	((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
	((lambda? exp)
	 (make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp)
			 (lambda-body exp)
			 env))
	((begin? exp)
	 (eval-sequence (begin-actions exp) env))
	((cond? exp) (eval (cond-&gt;if exp) env))
	((application? exp)
	 (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
		(list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
	(else
	 (error "Unknown expression type &#x2013; EVAL" exp))))
</p>

<p>
   For clarity, `eval' has been implemented as a case analysis using
`cond'.  The disadvantage of this is that our procedure handles only a
few distinguishable types of expressions, and no new ones can be
defined without editing the definition of `eval'.  In most Lisp
implementations, dispatching on the type of an expression is done in a
data-directed style.  This allows a user to add new types of
expressions that `eval' can distinguish, without modifying the
definition of `eval' itself.  (See *Note Exercise 4-3::.)
</p>

<p>
Apply
&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
`Apply' takes two arguments, a procedure and a list of arguments to
which the procedure should be applied.  `Apply' classifies procedures
into two kinds: It calls `apply-primitive-procedure' to apply
primitives; it applies compound procedures by sequentially evaluating
the expressions that make up the body of the procedure.  The
environment for the evaluation of the body of a compound procedure is
constructed by extending the base environment carried by the procedure
to include a frame that binds the parameters of the procedure to the
arguments to which the procedure is to be applied.  Here is the
definition of `apply':
</p>

<p>
(define (apply procedure arguments)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
	 (apply-primitive-procedure procedure arguments))
	((compound-procedure? procedure)
	 (eval-sequence
	   (procedure-body procedure)
	   (extend-environment
	     (procedure-parameters procedure)
	     arguments
	     (procedure-environment procedure))))
	(else
	 (error
	  "Unknown procedure type &#x2013; APPLY" procedure))))
</p>

<p>
Procedure arguments
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
When `eval' processes a procedure application, it uses `list-of-values'
to produce the list of arguments to which the procedure is to be
applied. `List-of-values' takes as an argument the operands of the
combination.  It evaluates each operand and returns a list of the
corresponding values:(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env)
	    (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env))))
</p>

<p>
Conditionals
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
`Eval-if' evaluates the predicate part of an `if' expression in the
given environment.  If the result is true, `eval-if' evaluates the
consequent, otherwise it evaluates the alternative:
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (eval (if-predicate exp) env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))
</p>

<p>
   The use of `true?' in `eval-if' highlights the issue of the
connection between an implemented language and an implementation
language.  The `if-predicate' is evaluated in the language being
implemented and thus yields a value in that language.  The interpreter
predicate `true?' translates that value into a value that can be tested
by the `if' in the implementation language: The metacircular
representation of truth might not be the same as that of the underlying
Scheme.(2)
</p>

<p>
Sequences
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
`Eval-sequence' is used by `apply' to evaluate the sequence of
expressions in a procedure body and by `eval' to evaluate the sequence
of expressions in a `begin' expression.  It takes as arguments a
sequence of expressions and an environment, and evaluates the
expressions in the order in which they occur.  The value returned is
the value of the final expression.
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-sequence exps env)
  (cond ((last-exp? exps) (eval (first-exp exps) env))
	(else (eval (first-exp exps) env)
	      (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) env))))
</p>

<p>
The following procedure handles assignments to variables.  It calls
`eval' to find the value to be assigned and transmits the variable and
the resulting value to `set-variable-value!' to be installed in the
designated environment.
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-assignment exp env)
  (set-variable-value! (assignment-variable exp)
		       (eval (assignment-value exp) env)
		       env)
  'ok)
</p>

<p>
Definitions of variables are handled in a similar manner.(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-definition exp env)
  (define-variable! (definition-variable exp)
		    (eval (definition-value exp) env)
		    env)
  'ok)
</p>

<p>
   We have chosen here to return the symbol `ok' as the value of an
assignment or a definition.(4)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.1:</b> Notice that we cannot tell whether the
metacircular evaluator evaluates operands from left to right or
from right to left.  Its evaluation order is inherited from the
underlying Lisp: If the arguments to `cons' in `list-of-values'
are evaluated from left to right, then `list-of-values' will
evaluate operands from left to right; and if the arguments to
`cons' are evaluated from right to left, then `list-of-values'
will evaluate operands from right to left.
</p>

<p>
Write a version of `list-of-values' that evaluates operands from
left to right regardless of the order of evaluation in the
underlying Lisp.  Also write a version of `list-of-values' that
evaluates operands from right to left.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
   (1) We could have simplified the `application?' clause in `eval' by
using `map' (and stipulating that `operands' returns a list) rather
than writing an explicit `list-of-values' procedure.  We chose not to
use `map' here to emphasize the fact that the evaluator can be
implemented without any use of higher-order procedures (and thus could
be written in a language that doesn't have higher-order procedures),
even though the language that it supports will include higher-order
procedures.
</p>

<p>
   (2) In this case, the language being implemented and the
implementation language are the same.  Contemplation of the meaning of
`true?' here yields expansion of consciousness without the abuse of
substance.
</p>

<p>
   (3) This implementation of `define' ignores a subtle issue in the
handling of internal definitions, although it works correctly in most
cases.  We will see what the problem is and how to solve it in section
*Note 4-1-6::.
</p>

<p>
   (4) As we said when we introduced `define' and `set!', these values
are implementation-dependent in Scheme&#x2013;that is, the implementor can
choose what value to return.

<p>
The evaluator is reminiscent of the symbolic differentiation program
discussed in section *Note 2-3-2::.  Both programs operate on symbolic
expressions.  In both programs, the result of operating on a compound
expression is determined by operating recursively on the pieces of the
expression and combining the results in a way that depends on the type
of the expression.  In both programs we used data abstraction to
decouple the general rules of operation from the details of how
expressions are represented.  In the differentiation program this meant
that the same differentiation procedure could deal with algebraic
expressions in prefix form, in infix form, or in some other form.  For
the evaluator, this means that the syntax of the language being
evaluated is determined solely by the procedures that classify and
extract pieces of expressions.
</p>

<p>
Here is the specification of the syntax of our language:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
The only self-evaluating items are numbers and strings:
</p>

<p>
(define (self-evaluating? exp)
  (cond ((number? exp) true)
	((string? exp) true)
	(else false)))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Variables are represented by symbols:
</p>

<p>
(define (variable? exp) (symbol? exp))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Quotations have the form `(quote &lt;TEXT-OF-QUOTATION&gt;)':(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (quoted? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'quote))
</p>

<p>
(define (text-of-quotation exp) (cadr exp))
</p>

<p>
`Quoted?' is defined in terms of the procedure `tagged-list?',
which identifies lists beginning with a designated symbol:
</p>

<p>
(define (tagged-list? exp tag)
  (if (pair? exp)
      (eq? (car exp) tag)
      false))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Assignments have the form `(set! &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt;)':
</p>

<p>
(define (assignment? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'set!))
</p>

<p>
(define (assignment-variable exp) (cadr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (assignment-value exp) (caddr exp))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Definitions have the form
</p>

<p>
(define &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt;)
</p>

<p>
or the form
</p>

<p>
(define (&lt;VAR&gt; &lt;PARAMETER<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;PARAMETER<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
  &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
The latter form (standard procedure definition) is syntactic sugar
for
</p>

<p>
(define &lt;VAR&gt;
  (lambda (&lt;PARAMETER<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;PARAMETER<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
    &lt;BODY&gt;))
</p>

<p>
The corresponding syntax procedures are the following:
</p>

<p>
(define (definition? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp 'define))
</p>

<p>
(define (definition-variable exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (cadr exp)
      (caadr exp)))
</p>

<p>
(define (definition-value exp)
  (if (symbol? (cadr exp))
      (caddr exp)
      (make-lambda (cdadr exp)   ; formal parameters
		   (cddr exp)))) ; body
</p></li>

<li><p>
`Lambda' expressions are lists that begin with the symbol `lambda':
</p>

<p>
(define (lambda? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'lambda))
</p>

<p>
(define (lambda-parameters exp) (cadr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (lambda-body exp) (cddr exp))
</p>

<p>
We also provide a constructor for `lambda' expressions, which is
used by `definition-value', above:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-lambda parameters body)
  (cons 'lambda (cons parameters body)))
</p></li>

<li><p>
Conditionals begin with `if' and have a predicate, a consequent,
and an (optional) alternative.  If the expression has no
alternative part, we provide `false' as the alternative.(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (if? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'if))
</p>

<p>
(define (if-predicate exp) (cadr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (if-consequent exp) (caddr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (if-alternative exp)
  (if (not (null? (cdddr exp)))
      (cadddr exp)
      'false))
</p>

<p>
We also provide a constructor for `if' expressions, to be used by
`cond-&gt;if' to transform `cond' expressions into `if' expressions:
</p>

<p>
(define (make-if predicate consequent alternative)
  (list 'if predicate consequent alternative))
</p></li>

<li><p>
`Begin' packages a sequence of expressions into a single
expression.  We include syntax operations on `begin' expressions
to extract the actual sequence from the `begin' expression, as
well as selectors that return the first expression and the rest of
the expressions in the sequence.(3)
</p>

<p>
(define (begin? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'begin))
</p>

<p>
(define (begin-actions exp) (cdr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (last-exp? seq) (null? (cdr seq)))
</p>

<p>
(define (first-exp seq) (car seq))
</p>

<p>
(define (rest-exps seq) (cdr seq))
</p>

<p>
We also include a constructor `sequence-&gt;exp' (for use by
`cond-&gt;if') that transforms a sequence into a single expression,
using `begin' if necessary:
</p>

<p>
(define (sequence-&gt;exp seq)
  (cond ((null? seq) seq)
	((last-exp? seq) (first-exp seq))
	(else (make-begin seq))))
</p>

<p>
(define (make-begin seq) (cons 'begin seq))
</p></li>

<li><p>
A procedure application is any compound expression that is not one
of the above expression types.  The `car' of the expression is the
operator, and the `cdr' is the list of operands:
</p>

<p>
(define (application? exp) (pair? exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (operator exp) (car exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (operands exp) (cdr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (no-operands? ops) (null? ops))
</p>

<p>
(define (first-operand ops) (car ops))
</p>

<p>
(define (rest-operands ops) (cdr ops))
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
Derived expressions
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Some special forms in our language can be defined in terms of
expressions involving other special forms, rather than being
implemented directly.  One example is `cond', which can be implemented
as a nest of `if' expressions.  For example, we can reduce the problem
of evaluating the expression
</p>

<p>
(cond ((&gt; x 0) x)
      ((= x 0) (display 'zero) 0)
      (else (- x)))
</p>

<p>
to the problem of evaluating the following expression involving `if' and
`begin' expressions:
</p>

<p>
(if (&gt; x 0)
    x
    (if (= x 0)
	(begin (display 'zero)
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>
(- x)))
</p>

<p>
   Implementing the evaluation of `cond' in this way simplifies the
evaluator because it reduces the number of special forms for which the
evaluation process must be explicitly specified.
</p>

<p>
   We include syntax procedures that extract the parts of a `cond'
expression, and a procedure `cond-&gt;if' that transforms `cond'
expressions into `if' expressions.  A case analysis begins with `cond'
and has a list of predicate-action clauses.  A clause is an `else'
clause if its predicate is the symbol `else'.(4)
</p>

<p>
(define (cond? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'cond))
</p>

<p>
(define (cond-clauses exp) (cdr exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (cond-else-clause? clause)
  (eq? (cond-predicate clause) 'else))
</p>

<p>
(define (cond-predicate clause) (car clause))
</p>

<p>
(define (cond-actions clause) (cdr clause))
</p>

<p>
(define (cond-&gt;if exp)
  (expand-clauses (cond-clauses exp)))
</p>

<p>
(define (expand-clauses clauses)
  (if (null? clauses)
      'false                          ; no `else' clause
      (let ((first (car clauses))
	    (rest (cdr clauses)))
	(if (cond-else-clause? first)
	    (if (null? rest)
		(sequence-&gt;exp (cond-actions first))
		(error "ELSE clause isn't last &#x2013; COND-&gt;IF"
		       clauses))
	    (make-if (cond-predicate first)
		     (sequence-&gt;exp (cond-actions first))
		     (expand-clauses rest))))))
</p>

<p>
   Expressions (such as `cond') that we choose to implement as syntactic
transformations are called "derived expressions".  `Let' expressions
are also derived expressions (see *Note Exercise 4-6::).(5)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.2:</b> Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the `cond' clauses
in `eval' so that the clause for procedure applications appears
before the clause for assignments.  He argues that this will make
the interpreter more efficient: Since programs usually contain more
applications than assignments, definitions, and so on, his
modified `eval' will usually check fewer clauses than the original
`eval' before identifying the type of an expression.
</p>

<p>
a. What is wrong with Louis's plan?  (Hint: What will Louis's
   evaluator do with the expression `(define x 3)'?)
</p>

<p>
b. Louis is upset that his plan didn't work.  He is willing to
   go to any lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure
   applications before it checks for most other kinds of
   expressions.  Help him by changing the syntax of the
   evaluated language so that procedure applications start with
   `call'.  For example, instead of `(factorial 3)' we will now
   have to write `(call factorial 3)' and instead of `(+ 1 2)'
   we will have to write `(call + 1 2)'.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.3:</b> Rewrite `eval' so that the dispatch is done in
data-directed style.  Compare this with the data-directed
differentiation procedure of *Note Exercise 2-73::.  (You may use
the `car' of a compound expression as the type of the expression,
as is appropriate for the syntax implemented in this section.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.4:</b> Recall the definitions of the special forms `and'
and `or' from *Note Chapter 1:::
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`and': The expressions are evaluated from left to right.  If
any expression evaluates to false, false is returned; any
remaining expressions are not evaluated.  If all the
expressions evaluate to true values, the value of the last
expression is returned.  If there are no expressions then
true is returned.</li>

<li>`or': The expressions are evaluated from left to right.  If
any expression evaluates to a true value, that value is
returned; any remaining expressions are not evaluated.  If
all expressions evaluate to false, or if there are no
expressions, then false is returned.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Install `and' and `or' as new special forms for the evaluator by
defining appropriate syntax procedures and evaluation procedures
`eval-and' and `eval-or'.  Alternatively, show how to implement
`and' and `or' as derived expressions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.5:</b> Scheme allows an additional syntax for `cond'
clauses, `(&lt;TEST&gt; =&gt; &lt;RECIPIENT&gt;)'.  If &lt;TEST&gt; evaluates to a true
value, then &lt;RECIPIENT&gt; is evaluated.  Its value must be a
procedure of one argument; this procedure is then invoked on the
value of the &lt;TEST&gt;, and the result is returned as the value of
the `cond' expression.  For example
</p>

<p>
(cond ((assoc 'b '((a 1) (b 2))) =&gt; cadr)
      (else false))
</p>

<p>
returns 2.  Modify the handling of `cond' so that it supports this
extended syntax.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.6:</b> `Let' expressions are derived expressions, because
</p>

<p>
(let ((&lt;VAR<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;EXP<sub>1</sub>&gt;) &#x2026; (&lt;VAR<sub>N</sub>&gt; &lt;EXP<sub>N</sub>&gt;))
  &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
is equivalent to
</p>

<p>
((lambda (&lt;VAR<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;VAR<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
   &lt;BODY&gt;)
 &lt;EXP<sub>1</sub>&gt;
 &#x2026;
 &lt;EXP<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
Implement a syntactic transformation `let-&gt;combination' that
reduces evaluating `let' expressions to evaluating combinations of
the type shown above, and add the appropriate clause to `eval' to
handle `let' expressions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.7:</b> `Let*' is similar to `let', except that the
bindings of the `let' variables are performed sequentially from
left to right, and each binding is made in an environment in which
all of the preceding bindings are visible.  For example
</p>

<p>
(let* ((x 3)
       (y (+ x 2))
       (z (+ x y 5)))
  (* x z))
</p>

<p>
returns 39.  Explain how a `let*' expression can be rewritten as a
set of nested `let' expressions, and write a procedure
`let*-&gt;nested-lets' that performs this transformation.  If we have
already implemented `let' (<b>Note Exercise 4-6::) and we want to
extend the evaluator to handle `let</b>', is it sufficient to add a
clause to `eval' whose action is
</p>

<p>
(eval (let*-&gt;nested-lets exp) env)
</p>

<p>
or must we explicitly expand `let*' in terms of non-derived
expressions?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.8:</b> "Named `let'" is a variant of `let' that has the
form
</p>

<p>
(let &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;BINDINGS&gt; &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
The &lt;BINDINGS&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; are just as in ordinary `let', except
that &lt;VAR&gt; is bound within &lt;BODY&gt; to a procedure whose body is
&lt;BODY&gt; and whose parameters are the variables in the &lt;BINDINGS&gt;.
Thus, one can repeatedly execute the &lt;BODY&gt; by invoking the
procedure named &lt;VAR&gt;.  For example, the iterative Fibonacci
procedure (section *Note 1-2-2::) can be rewritten using named
`let' as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (fib n)
  (let fib-iter ((a 1)
		 (b 0)
		 (count n))
    (if (= count 0)
	b
	(fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1)))))
</p>

<p>
Modify `let-&gt;combination' of *Note Exercise 4-6:: to also support
named `let'.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.9:</b> Many languages support a variety of iteration
constructs, such as `do', `for', `while', and `until'.  In Scheme,
iterative processes can be expressed in terms of ordinary
procedure calls, so special iteration constructs provide no
essential gain in computational power.  On the other hand, such
constructs are often convenient.  Design some iteration
constructs, give examples of their use, and show how to implement
them as derived expressions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.10:</b> By using data abstraction, we were able to write
an `eval' procedure that is independent of the particular syntax
of the language to be evaluated.  To illustrate this, design and
implement a new syntax for Scheme by modifying the procedures in
this section, without changing `eval' or `apply'.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) As mentioned in section *Note 2-3-1::, the evaluator sees a
quoted expression as a list beginning with `quote', even if the
expression is typed with the quotation mark.  For example, the
expression `'a' would be seen by the evaluator as `(quote a)'.  See
*Note Exercise 2-55::.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The value of an `if' expression when the predicate is false and
there is no alternative is unspecified in Scheme; we have chosen here
to make it false.  We will support the use of the variables `true' and
`false' in expressions to be evaluated by binding them in the global
environment.  See section *Note 4-1-4::.
</p>

<p>
   (3) These selectors for a list of expressions&#x2013;and the corresponding
ones for a list of operands&#x2013;are not intended as a data abstraction.
They are introduced as mnemonic names for the basic list operations in
order to make it easier to understand the explicit-control evaluator in
section *Note 5-4::.
</p>

<p>
   (4) The value of a `cond' expression when all the predicates are
false and there is no `else' clause is unspecified in Scheme; we have
chosen here to make it false.
</p>

<p>
   (5) Practical Lisp systems provide a mechanism that allows a user to
add new derived expressions and specify their implementation as
syntactic transformations without modifying the evaluator.  Such a
user-defined transformation is called a "macro".  Although it is easy
to add an elementary mechanism for defining macros, the resulting
language has subtle name-conflict problems.  There has been much
research on mechanisms for macro definition that do not cause these
difficulties.  See, for example, Kohlbecker 1986, Clinger and Rees
1991, and Hanson 1991.

</p>

<p>
To handle primitives, we assume that we have available the following
procedures:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
`(apply-primitive-procedure &lt;PROC&gt; &lt;ARGS&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
applies the given primitive procedure to the argument values in
the list &lt;ARGS&gt; and returns the result of the application.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(primitive-procedure? &lt;PROC&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
tests whether &lt;PROC&gt; is a primitive procedure.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
   These mechanisms for handling primitives are further described in
section *Note 4-1-4::.

   Compound procedures are constructed from parameters, procedure

Operations on Environments
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The evaluator needs operations for manipulating environments.  As
explained in section *Note 3-2::, an environment is a sequence of
frames, where each frame is a table of bindings that associate
variables with their corresponding values.  We use the following
operations for manipulating environments:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
`(lookup-variable-value &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;ENV&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
returns the value that is bound to the symbol &lt;VAR&gt; in the
environment &lt;ENV&gt;, or signals an error if the variable is unbound.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(extend-environment &lt;VARIABLES&gt; &lt;VALUES&gt; &lt;BASE-ENV&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
returns a new environment, consisting of a new frame in which the
symbols in the list &lt;VARIABLES&gt; are bound to the corresponding
elements in the list &lt;VALUES&gt;, where the enclosing environment is
the environment &lt;BASE-ENV&gt;.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(define-variable! &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt; &lt;ENV&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
adds to the first frame in the environment &lt;ENV&gt; a new binding that
associates the variable &lt;VAR&gt; with the value &lt;VALUE&gt;.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(set-variable-value! &lt;VAR&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt; &lt;ENV&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
changes the binding of the variable &lt;VAR&gt; in the environment &lt;ENV&gt;
so that the variable is now bound to the value &lt;VALUE&gt;, or signals
an error if the variable is unbound.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
   To implement these operations we represent an environment as a list
of frames.  The enclosing environment of an environment is the `cdr' of
the list.  The empty environment is simply the empty list.
</p>

<p>
(define (enclosing-environment env) (cdr env))
</p>

<p>
(define (first-frame env) (car env))
</p>

<p>
(define the-empty-environment '())
</p>

<p>
   Each frame of an environment is represented as a pair of lists: a
list of the variables bound in that frame and a list of the associated
values.(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (make-frame variables values)
  (cons variables values))
</p>

<p>
(define (frame-variables frame) (car frame))
</p>

</p>

<p>
   To extend an environment by a new frame that associates variables
with values, we make a frame consisting of the list of variables and
the list of values, and we adjoin this to the environment.  We signal
an error if the number of variables does not match the number of values.
</p>

<p>
(define (extend-environment vars vals base-env)
  (if (= (length vars) (length vals))

	  (error "Too many arguments supplied" vars vals)
	  (error "Too few arguments supplied" vars vals))))
</p>

<p>
   To look up a variable in an environment, we scan the list of
variables in the first frame.  If we find the desired variable, we
return the corresponding element in the list of values.  If we do not
find the variable in the current frame, we search the enclosing
environment, and so on.  If we reach the empty environment, we signal
an "unbound variable" error.
</p>

<p>
(define (lookup-variable-value var env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
	     (env-loop (enclosing-environment env)))
	    ((eq? var (car vars))
	     (car vals))
	    (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
	(error "Unbound variable" var)
	(let ((frame (first-frame env)))
	  (scan (frame-variables frame)
		(frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
</p>

<p>
   To set a variable to a new value in a specified environment, we scan
for the variable, just as in `lookup-variable-value', and change the
corresponding value when we find it.
</p>

<p>
(define (set-variable-value! var val env)
  (define (env-loop env)
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)

	     (set-car! vals val))
	    (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (if (eq? env the-empty-environment)
	(error "Unbound variable &#x2013; SET!" var)
	(let ((frame (first-frame env)))
	  (scan (frame-variables frame)
		(frame-values frame)))))
  (env-loop env))
</p>

<p>
   To define a variable, we search the first frame for a binding for
the variable, and change the binding if it exists (just as in
`set-variable-value!').  If no such binding exists, we adjoin one to
the first frame.
</p>

<p>
(define (define-variable! var val env)
  (let ((frame (first-frame env)))
    (define (scan vars vals)
      (cond ((null? vars)
	     (add-binding-to-frame! var val frame))
	    ((eq? var (car vars))
	     (set-car! vals val))
	    (else (scan (cdr vars) (cdr vals)))))
    (scan (frame-variables frame)
	  (frame-values frame))))
</p>

<p>
   The method described here is only one of many plausible ways to
represent environments.  Since we used data abstraction to isolate the
rest of the evaluator from the detailed choice of representation, we
could change the environment representation if we wanted to.  (See
*Note Exercise 4-11::.)  In a production-quality Lisp system, the speed
of the evaluator's environment operations&#x2013;especially that of variable
lookup&#x2013;has a major impact on the performance of the system.  The
representation described here, although conceptually simple, is not
efficient and would not ordinarily be used in a production system.(2)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.11:</b> Instead of representing a frame as a pair of
lists, we can represent a frame as a list of bindings, where each
binding is a name-value pair.  Rewrite the environment operations
to use this alternative representation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.12:</b> The procedures `set-variable-value!',
`define-variable!', and `lookup-variable-value' can be expressed
in terms of more abstract procedures for traversing the
environment structure.  Define abstractions that capture the
common patterns and redefine the three procedures in terms of these
abstractions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.13:</b> Scheme allows us to create new bindings for
variables by means of `define', but provides no way to get rid of
bindings.  Implement for the evaluator a special form
`make-unbound!' that removes the binding of a given symbol from the
environment in which the `make-unbound!' expression is evaluated.
This problem is not completely specified.  For example, should we
remove only the binding in the first frame of the environment?
Complete the specification and justify any choices you make.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Frames are not really a data abstraction in the following code:
`Set-variable-value!' and `define-variable!' use `set-car!'  to
directly modify the values in a frame.  The purpose of the frame
procedures is to make the environment-manipulation procedures easy to
read.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The drawback of this representation (as well as the variant in
*Note Exercise 4-11::) is that the evaluator may have to search through
many frames in order to find the binding for a given variable.  (Such
an approach is referred to as "deep binding".)  One way to avoid this
inefficiency is to make use of a strategy called "lexical addressing",
which will be discussed in section *Note 5-5-6::.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<hr />

<p>
Given the evaluator, we have in our hands a description (expressed in
Lisp) of the process by which Lisp expressions are evaluated.  One
advantage of expressing the evaluator as a program is that we can run
the program.  This gives us, running within Lisp, a working model of
how Lisp itself evaluates expressions.  This can serve as a framework
for experimenting with evaluation rules, as we shall do later in this
chapter.
</p>

<p>
   Our evaluator program reduces expressions ultimately to the
application of primitive procedures.  Therefore, all that we need to
run the evaluator is to create a mechanism that calls on the underlying
Lisp system to model the application of primitive procedures.
</p>

<p>
   There must be a binding for each primitive procedure name, so that
when `eval' evaluates the operator of an application of a primitive, it
will find an object to pass to `apply'.  We thus set up a global
environment that associates unique objects with the names of the
primitive procedures that can appear in the expressions we will be
evaluating.  The global environment also includes bindings for the
symbols `true' and `false', so that they can be used as variables in
expressions to be evaluated.
</p>

<p>
(define (setup-environment)
  (let ((initial-env
	 (extend-environment (primitive-procedure-names)
			     (primitive-procedure-objects)
			     the-empty-environment)))
    (define-variable! 'true true initial-env)
    (define-variable! 'false false initial-env)
    initial-env))
</p>

<p>
(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))
</p>

<p>
   It does not matter how we represent the primitive procedure objects,
so long as `apply' can identify and apply them by using the procedures
`primitive-procedure?' and `apply-primitive-procedure'.  We have chosen
to represent a primitive procedure as a list beginning with the symbol
`primitive' and containing a procedure in the underlying Lisp that
implements that primitive.
</p>

<p>
(define (primitive-procedure? proc)
  (tagged-list? proc 'primitive))
</p>

<p>
(define (primitive-implementation proc) (cadr proc))
</p>

<p>
   `Setup-environment' will get the primitive names and implementation
procedures from a list:(1)
</p>

<p>
(define primitive-procedures
  (list (list 'car car)
	(list 'cdr cdr)
	(list 'cons cons)
	(list 'null? null?)
	&lt;MORE PRIMITIVES&gt;
	))
</p>

<p>
(define (primitive-procedure-names)
  (map car
       primitive-procedures))
</p>

<p>
(define (primitive-procedure-objects)
  (map (lambda (proc) (list 'primitive (cadr proc)))
       primitive-procedures))
</p>

<p>
   To apply a primitive procedure, we simply apply the implementation
procedure to the arguments, using the underlying Lisp system:(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-primitive-procedure proc args)
  (apply-in-underlying-scheme
   (primitive-implementation proc) args))
</p>

<p>
   For convenience in running the metacircular evaluator, we provide a "driver
loop" that models the read-eval-print loop of the underlying Lisp
system.  It prints a "prompt", reads an input expression, evaluates
this expression in the global environment, and prints the result.  We
precede each printed result by an "output prompt" so as to distinguish
the value of the expression from other output that may be printed.(3)
</p>

<p>
(define input-prompt ";;; M-Eval input:")
(define output-prompt ";;; M-Eval value:")
</p>

<p>
(define (driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let ((input (read)))
    (let ((output (eval input the-global-environment)))
      (announce-output output-prompt)
      (user-print output)))
  (driver-loop))
</p>

<p>
(define (prompt-for-input string)
  (newline) (newline) (display string) (newline))
</p>

<p>
(define (announce-output string)
  (newline) (display string) (newline))
</p>

<p>
   We use a special printing procedure, `user-print', to avoid printing
the environment part of a compound procedure, which may be a very long
list (or may even contain cycles).
</p>

<p>
(define (user-print object)
  (if (compound-procedure? object)
      (display (list 'compound-procedure
		     (procedure-parameters object)
		     (procedure-body object)
		     '&lt;procedure-env&gt;))
      (display object)))
</p>

<p>
   Now all we need to do to run the evaluator is to initialize the
global environment and start the driver loop.  Here is a sample
interaction:
</p>

<p>
(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))
</p>

<p>
(driver-loop)
</p>

<p>
;;; M-Eval input:
(define (append x y)
  (if (null? x)
      y
      (cons (car x)
	    (append (cdr x) y))))
;;; M-Eval value:
ok
</p>

<p>
;;; M-Eval input:
(append '(a b c) '(d e f))
;;; M-Eval value:
(a b c d e f)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.14:</b> Eva Lu Ator and Louis Reasoner are each
experimenting with the metacircular evaluator.  Eva types in the
definition of `map', and runs some test programs that use it.
They work fine.  Louis, in contrast, has installed the system
version of `map' as a primitive for the metacircular evaluator.
When he tries it, things go terribly wrong.  Explain why Louis's
`map' fails even though Eva's works.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Any procedure defined in the underlying Lisp can be used as a
primitive for the metacircular evaluator.  The name of a primitive
installed in the evaluator need not be the same as the name of its
implementation in the underlying Lisp; the names are the same here
because the metacircular evaluator implements Scheme itself.  Thus, for
example, we could put `(list 'first car)' or `(list 'square (lambda (x)
(* x x)))' in the list of `primitive-procedures'.
</p>

<p>
   (2) `Apply-in-underlying-scheme' is the `apply' procedure we have
used in earlier chapters.  The metacircular evaluator's `apply'
procedure (section *Note 4-1-1::) models the working of this primitive.
Having two different things called `apply' leads to a technical
problem in running the metacircular evaluator, because defining the
metacircular evaluator's `apply' will mask the definition of the
primitive.  One way around this is to rename the metacircular `apply' to
avoid conflict with the name of the primitive procedure.  We have
assumed instead that we have saved a reference to the underlying
`apply' by doing
</p>

<p>
(define apply-in-underlying-scheme apply)
</p>

<p>
before defining the metacircular `apply'.  This allows us to access the
original version of `apply' under a different name.
</p>

<p>
   (3) The primitive procedure `read' waits for input from the user,
and returns the next complete expression that is typed.  For example,
if the user types `(+ 23 x)', `read' returns a three-element list
containing the symbol `+', the number 23, and the symbol `x'.  If the
user types `'x', `read' returns a two-element list containing the
symbol `quote' and the symbol `x'.

<p>
In thinking about a Lisp program that evaluates Lisp expressions, an
analogy might be helpful.  One operational view of the meaning of a
program is that a program is a description of an abstract (perhaps
infinitely large) machine.  For example, consider the familiar program
to compute factorials:
</p>

<p>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</p>

<p>
   We may regard this program as the description of a machine
containing parts that decrement, multiply, and test for equality,
together with a two-position switch and another factorial machine. (The
factorial machine is infinite because it contains another factorial
machine within it.)  *Note Figure 4-2:: is a flow diagram for the
factorial machine, showing how the parts are wired together.

<p>
   In a similar way, we can regard the evaluator as a very special
machine that takes as input a description of a machine.  Given this
input, the evaluator configures itself to emulate the machine
described.  For example, if we feed our evaluator the definition of
`factorial', as shown in *Note Figure 4-3::, the evaluator will be able
to compute factorials.
</p>

<p>
   From this perspective, our evaluator is seen to be a machine
"universal machine".  It mimics other machines when these are described
as Lisp programs.(1) This is striking. Try to imagine an analogous
evaluator for electrical circuits.  This would be a circuit that takes
as input a signal encoding the plans for some other circuit, such as a
filter.  Given this input, the circuit evaluator would then behave like
a filter with the same description.  Such a universal electrical
circuit is almost unimaginably complex.  It is remarkable that the
program evaluator is a rather simple program.(2)
</p>

<p>
   Another striking aspect of the evaluator is that it acts as a bridge
between the data objects that are manipulated by our programming
language and the programming language itself.  Imagine that the
evaluator program (implemented in Lisp) is running, and that a user is
typing expressions to the evaluator and observing the results.  From
the perspective of the user, an input expression such as `(* x x)' is
an expression in the programming language, which the evaluator should
execute.  From the perspective of the evaluator, however, the
expression is simply a list (in this case, a list of three symbols: `*',
`x', and `x') that is to be manipulated according to a well-defined set
of rules.
</p>

<p>
   That the user's programs are the evaluator's data need not be a
source of confusion.  In fact, it is sometimes convenient to ignore
this distinction, and to give the user the ability to explicitly
evaluate a data object as a Lisp expression, by making `eval' available
for use in programs.  Many Lisp dialects provide a primitive `eval'
procedure that takes as arguments an expression and an environment and
evaluates the expression relative to the environment.(3) Thus,
</p>

<p>
(eval '(* 5 5) user-initial-environment)
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
(eval (cons '* (list 5 5)) user-initial-environment)
</p>

<p>
will both return 25.(4)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.15:</b> Given a one-argument procedure `p' and an object
`a', `p' is said to "halt" on `a' if evaluating the expression `(p
a)' returns a value (as opposed to terminating with an error
message or running forever).  Show that it is impossible to write
a procedure `halts?' that correctly determines whether `p' halts
on `a' for any procedure `p' and object `a'.  Use the following
reasoning: If you had such a procedure `halts?', you could
implement the following program:
</p>

<p>
(define (run-forever) (run-forever))
</p>

<p>
(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))
</p>

<p>
Now consider evaluating the expression `(try try)' and show that
any possible outcome (either halting or running forever) violates
the intended behavior of `halts?'.(5)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) The fact that the machines are described in Lisp is inessential.
If we give our evaluator a Lisp program that behaves as an evaluator
for some other language, say C, the Lisp evaluator will emulate the C
evaluator, which in turn can emulate any machine described as a C
program.  Similarly, writing a Lisp evaluator in C produces a C program
that can execute any Lisp program.  The deep idea here is that any
evaluator can emulate any other.  Thus, the notion of "what can in
principle be computed" (ignoring practicalities of time and memory
required) is independent of the language or the computer, and instead
reflects an underlying notion of "computability".  This was first
demonstrated in a clear way by Alan M. Turing (1912-1954), whose 1936
paper laid the foundations for theoretical computer science.  In the
paper, Turing presented a simple computational model&#x2013;now known as a "Turing
machine"&#x2013;and argued that any "effective process" can be formulated as
a program for such a machine.  (This argument is known as the "Church-Turing
thesis".)  Turing then implemented a universal machine, i.e., a Turing
machine that behaves as an evaluator for Turing-machine programs.  He
used this framework to demonstrate that there are well-posed problems
that cannot be computed by Turing machines (see *Note Exercise 4-15::),
and so by implication cannot be formulated as "effective processes."
Turing went on to make fundamental contributions to practical computer
science as well.  For example, he invented the idea of structuring
programs using general-purpose subroutines.  See Hodges 1983 for a
biography of Turing.
</p>

<p>
   (2) Some people find it counterintuitive that an evaluator, which is
implemented by a relatively simple procedure, can emulate programs that
are more complex than the evaluator itself.  The existence of a
universal evaluator machine is a deep and wonderful property of
computation.  theory "Recursion theory", a branch of mathematical
logic, is concerned with logical limits of computation.  Douglas
Hofstadter's beautiful book `Go"del, Escher, Bach' (1979) explores some
of these ideas.
</p>

<p>
   (3) Warning: This `eval' primitive is not identical to the `eval'
procedure we implemented in section *Note 4-1-1::, because it uses
<span class="underline">actual</span> Scheme environments rather than the sample environment
structures we built in section *Note 4-1-3::.  These actual
environments cannot be manipulated by the user as ordinary lists; they
must be accessed via `eval' or other special operations.  Similarly,
the `apply' primitive we saw earlier is not identical to the
metacircular `apply', because it uses actual Scheme procedures rather
than the procedure objects we constructed in sections *Note 4-1-3:: and
*Note 4-1-4::.
</p>

<p>
   (4) The MIT implementation of Scheme includes `eval', as well as a
symbol `user-initial-environment' that is bound to the initial
environment in which the user's input expressions are evaluated.
</p>

<p>
   (5) Although we stipulated that `halts?' is given a procedure
object, notice that this reasoning still applies even if `halts?' can
gain access to the procedure's text and its environment.  This is
Turing's celebrated "Halting Theorem", which gave the first clear
example of a "non-computable" problem, i.e., a well-posed task that
cannot be carried out as a computational procedure.

<h3 id="org7c74b1f"><span class="section-number-3">1.6.</span> Internal Definitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<hr />

<p>
Our environment model of evaluation and our metacircular evaluator
execute definitions in sequence, extending the environment frame one
definition at a time.  This is particularly convenient for interactive
program development, in which the programmer needs to freely mix the
application of procedures with the definition of new procedures.
However, if we think carefully about the internal definitions used to
implement block structure (introduced in section *Note 1-1-8::), we
will find that name-by-name extension of the environment may not be the
best way to define local variables.
</p>

<p>
Consider a procedure with internal definitions, such as
</p>

<p>
(define (f x)
  (define (even? n)
    (if (= n 0)
	true
	(odd? (- n 1))))
  (define (odd? n)
    (if (= n 0)
	false
	(even? (- n 1))))
  &lt;REST OF BODY OF `F'&gt;)
</p>

<p>
   Our intention here is that the name `odd?' in the body of the
procedure `even?' should refer to the procedure `odd?' that is defined
after `even?'.  The scope of the name `odd?' is the entire body of `f',
not just the portion of the body of `f' starting at the point where the
`define' for `odd?' occurs.  Indeed, when we consider that `odd?' is
itself defined in terms of `even?'&#x2013;so that `even?' and `odd?' are
mutually recursive procedures&#x2013;we see that the only satisfactory
interpretation of the two `define's is to regard them as if the names
`even?' and `odd?' were being added to the environment simultaneously.
More generally, in block structure, the scope of a local name is the
entire procedure body in which the `define' is evaluated.
</p>

<p>
   As it happens, our interpreter will evaluate calls to `f' correctly,
but for an "accidental" reason: Since the definitions of the internal
procedures come first, no calls to these procedures will be evaluated
until all of them have been defined.  Hence, `odd?'  will have been
defined by the time `even?' is executed.  In fact, our sequential
evaluation mechanism will give the same result as a mechanism that
directly implements simultaneous definition for any procedure in which
the internal definitions come first in a body and evaluation of the
value expressions for the defined variables doesn't actually use any of
the defined variables.  (For an example of a procedure that doesn't
obey these restrictions, so that sequential definition isn't equivalent
to simultaneous definition, see *Note Exercise 4-19::.)(1)
</p>

<p>
   There is, however, a simple way to treat definitions so that
internally defined names have truly simultaneous scope&#x2013;just create all
local variables that will be in the current environment before
evaluating any of the value expressions.  One way to do this is by a
syntax transformation on `lambda' expressions.  Before evaluating the
body of a `lambda' expression, we "scan out" and eliminate all the
internal definitions in the body.  The internally defined variables
will be created with a `let' and then set to their values by
assignment.  For example, the procedure
</p>

<p>
(lambda &lt;VARS&gt;
  (define u &lt;E1&gt;)
  (define v &lt;E2&gt;)
  &lt;E3&gt;)
</p>

<p>
would be transformed into
</p>

<p>
(lambda &lt;VARS&gt;
  (let ((u '<b>unassigned</b>)
	(v '<b>unassigned</b>))
    (set! u &lt;E1&gt;)
    (set! v &lt;E2&gt;)
    &lt;E3&gt;))
</p>

<p>
where `*unassigned*' is a special symbol that causes looking up a
variable to signal an error if an attempt is made to use the value of
the not-yet-assigned variable.
</p>

<p>
   An alternative strategy for scanning out internal definitions is
shown in *Note Exercise 4-18::.  Unlike the transformation shown above,
this enforces the restriction that the defined variables' values can be
evaluated without using any of the variables' values.(2)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.16:</b> In this exercise we implement the method just
described for interpreting internal definitions.  We assume that
the evaluator supports `let' (see *Note Exercise 4-6::).
</p>

<p>
a. Change `lookup-variable-value' (section <b>Note 4-1-3::) to
   signal an error if the value it finds is the symbol
   `*unassigned</b>'.
</p>

<p>
b. Write a procedure `scan-out-defines' that takes a procedure
   body and returns an equivalent one that has no internal
   definitions, by making the transformation described above.
</p>

<p>
c. Install `scan-out-defines' in the interpreter, either in
   `make-procedure' or in `procedure-body' (see section *Note
   4-1-3::).  Which place is better?  Why?
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.17:</b> Draw diagrams of the environment in effect when
evaluating the expression &lt;E3&gt; in the procedure in the text,
comparing how this will be structured when definitions are
interpreted sequentially with how it will be structured if
definitions are scanned out as described.  Why is there an extra
frame in the transformed program?  Explain why this difference in
environment structure can never make a difference in the behavior
of a correct program.  Design a way to make the interpreter
implement the "simultaneous" scope rule for internal definitions
without constructing the extra frame.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.18:</b> Consider an alternative strategy for scanning out
definitions that translates the example in the text to
</p>

<p>
(lambda &lt;VARS&gt;
  (let ((u '<b>unassigned</b>)
	(v '<b>unassigned</b>))
    (let ((a &lt;E1&gt;)
	  (b &lt;E2&gt;))
      (set! u a)
      (set! v b))
    &lt;E3&gt;))
</p>

<p>
Here `a' and `b' are meant to represent new variable names, created
by the interpreter, that do not appear in the user's program.
Consider the `solve' procedure from section *Note 3-5-4:::
</p>

<p>
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
  (define dy (stream-map f y))
  y)
</p>

<p>
Will this procedure work if internal definitions are scanned out
as shown in this exercise?  What if they are scanned out as shown
in the text?  Explain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.19:</b> Ben Bitdiddle, Alyssa P. Hacker, and Eva Lu Ator
are arguing about the desired result of evaluating the expression
</p>

<p>
(let ((a 1))
  (define (f x)
    (define b (+ a x))
    (define a 5)
    (+ a b))
  (f 10))
</p>

<p>
Ben asserts that the result should be obtained using the
sequential rule for `define': `b' is defined to be 11, then `a' is
defined to be 5, so the result is 16.  Alyssa objects that mutual
recursion requires the simultaneous scope rule for internal
procedure definitions, and that it is unreasonable to treat
procedure names differently from other names.  Thus, she argues
for the mechanism implemented in *Note Exercise 4-16::.  This
would lead to `a' being unassigned at the time that the value for
`b' is to be computed.  Hence, in Alyssa's view the procedure
should produce an error.  Eva has a third opinion.  She says that
if the definitions of `a' and `b' are truly meant to be
simultaneous, then the value 5 for `a' should be used in
evaluating `b'.  Hence, in Eva's view `a' should be 5, `b' should
be 15, and the result should be 20.  Which (if any) of these
viewpoints do you support?  Can you devise a way to implement
internal definitions so that they behave as Eva prefers?(3)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.20:</b> Because internal definitions look sequential but
are actually simultaneous, some people prefer to avoid them
entirely, and use the special form `letrec' instead.  `Letrec'
looks like `let', so it is not surprising that the variables it
binds are bound simultaneously and have the same scope as each
other.  The sample procedure `f' above can be written without
internal definitions, but with exactly the same meaning, as
</p>

<p>
(define (f x)
  (letrec ((even?
	    (lambda (n)
	      (if (= n 0)
		  true
		  (odd? (- n 1)))))
	   (odd?
	    (lambda (n)
	      (if (= n 0)
		  false
		  (even? (- n 1))))))
    &lt;REST OF BODY OF `F'&gt;))
</p>

<p>
`Letrec' expressions, which have the form
</p>

<p>
(letrec ((&lt;VAR<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;EXP<sub>1</sub>&gt;) &#x2026; (&lt;VAR<sub>N</sub>&gt; &lt;EXP<sub>N</sub>&gt;))
  &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
are a variation on `let' in which the expressions &lt;EXP<sub>K</sub>&gt; that
provide the initial values for the variables &lt;VAR<sub>K</sub>&gt; are evaluated
in an environment that includes all the `letrec' bindings.  This
permits recursion in the bindings, such as the mutual recursion of
`even?' and `odd?' in the example above, or the evaluation of 10
factorial with
</p>

<p>
(letrec ((fact
	  (lambda (n)
	    (if (= n 1)
		1
		(* n (fact (- n 1)))))))
  (fact 10))
</p>

<p>
a. Implement `letrec' as a derived expression, by transforming a
   `letrec' expression into a `let' expression as shown in the
   text above or in *Note Exercise 4-18::.  That is, the
   `letrec' variables should be created with a `let' and then be
   assigned their values with `set!'.
</p>

<p>
b. Louis Reasoner is confused by all this fuss about internal
   definitions.  The way he sees it, if you don't like to use
   `define' inside a procedure, you can just use `let'.
   Illustrate what is loose about his reasoning by drawing an
   environment diagram that shows the environment in which the
   &lt;REST OF BODY OF `F'&gt; is evaluated during evaluation of the
   expression `(f 5)', with `f' defined as in this exercise.
   Draw an environment diagram for the same evaluation, but with
   `let' in place of `letrec' in the definition of `f'.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.21:</b> Amazingly, Louis's intuition in *Note Exercise
4-20:: is correct.  It is indeed possible to specify recursive
procedures without using `letrec' (or even `define'), although the
method for accomplishing this is much more subtle than Louis
imagined.  The following expression computes 10 factorial by
applying a recursive factorial procedure:(4)
</p>

<p>
((lambda (n)
   ((lambda (fact)
      (fact fact n))
    (lambda (ft k)

	  (* k (ft ft (- k 1)))))))

<p>
a. Check (by evaluating the expression) that this really does
   compute factorials.  Devise an analogous expression for
   computing Fibonacci numbers.
</p>

<p>
b. Consider the following procedure, which includes mutually
   recursive internal definitions:
</p>

<p>
(define (f x)
  (define (even? n)
    (if (= n 0)
	true
	(odd? (- n 1))))
  (define (odd? n)
    (if (= n 0)
	false
	(even? (- n 1))))
  (even? x))
</p>

<p>
Fill in the missing expressions to complete an alternative
definition of `f', which uses neither internal definitions
nor `letrec':
</p>

<p>
(define (f x)
  ((lambda (even? odd?)
     (even? even? odd? x))
   (lambda (ev? od? n)
     (if (= n 0) true (od? &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;)))
   (lambda (ev? od? n)
     (if (= n 0) false (ev? &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;)))))

</p>

<p>
   (1) Wanting programs to not depend on this evaluation mechanism is
the reason for the "management is not responsible" remark in *Note
Footnote 28:: of *Note Chapter 1::.  By insisting that internal
definitions come first and do not use each other while the definitions
are being evaluated, the IEEE standard for Scheme leaves implementors
some choice in the mechanism used to evaluate these definitions.  The
choice of one evaluation rule rather than another here may seem like a
small issue, affecting only the interpretation of "badly formed"
programs.  However, we will see in section *Note 5-5-6:: that moving to
a model of simultaneous scoping for internal definitions avoids some
nasty difficulties that would otherwise arise in implementing a
compiler.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The IEEE standard for Scheme allows for different implementation
strategies by specifying that it is up to the programmer to obey this
restriction, not up to the implementation to enforce it.  Some Scheme
implementations, including MIT Scheme, use the transformation shown
above.  Thus, some programs that don't obey this restriction will in
fact run in such implementations.
</p>

<p>
   (3) The MIT implementors of Scheme support Alyssa on the following
grounds: Eva is in principle correct - the definitions should be
regarded as simultaneous.  But it seems difficult to implement a
general, efficient mechanism that does what Eva requires.  In the
absence of such a mechanism, it is better to generate an error in the
difficult cases of simultaneous definitions (Alyssa's notion) than to
produce an incorrect answer (as Ben would have it).
</p>

<p>
   (4) This example illustrates a programming trick for formulating
recursive procedures without using `define'.  The most general trick of
this sort is the Y "operator", which can be used to give a "pure
[lambda]-calculus" implementation of recursion.  (See Stoy 1977 for
details on the [lambda] calculus, and Gabriel 1988 for an exposition of
the Y operator in Scheme.)

<h3 id="org96d23bb"><span class="section-number-3">1.7.</span> Separating Syntactic Analysis from Execution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<hr />

<p>
The evaluator implemented above is simple, but it is very inefficient,
because the syntactic analysis of expressions is interleaved with their
execution.  Thus if a program is executed many times, its syntax is
analyzed many times.  Consider, for example, evaluating `(factorial 4)'
using the following definition of `factorial':
</p>

<p>
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* (factorial (- n 1)) n)))
</p>

<p>
   Each time `factorial' is called, the evaluator must determine that
the body is an `if' expression and extract the predicate.  Only then
can it evaluate the predicate and dispatch on its value.  Each time it
evaluates the expression `(* (factorial (- n 1)) n)', or the
subexpressions `(factorial (- n 1))' and `(- n 1)', the evaluator must
perform the case analysis in `eval' to determine that the expression is
an application, and must extract its operator and operands.  This
analysis is expensive.  Performing it repeatedly is wasteful.
</p>

<p>
   We can transform the evaluator to be significantly more efficient by
arranging things so that syntactic analysis is performed only once.(1)
We split `eval', which takes an expression and an environment, into two
parts.  The procedure `analyze' takes only the expression.  It performs
the syntactic analysis and returns a new procedure, the "execution
procedure", that encapsulates the work to be done in executing the
analyzed expression.  The execution procedure takes an environment as
its argument and completes the evaluation.  This saves work because
`analyze' will be called only once on an expression, while the
execution procedure may be called many times.
</p>

<p>
With the separation into analysis and execution, `eval' now becomes
</p>

<p>
(define (eval exp env)
  ((analyze exp) env))
</p>

<p>
   The result of calling `analyze' is the execution procedure to be
applied to the environment.  The `analyze' procedure is the same case
analysis as performed by the original `eval' of section *Note 4-1-1::,
except that the procedures to which we dispatch perform only analysis,
not full evaluation:
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze exp)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp)
	 (analyze-self-evaluating exp))
	((quoted? exp) (analyze-quoted exp))
	((variable? exp) (analyze-variable exp))
	((assignment? exp) (analyze-assignment exp))
	((definition? exp) (analyze-definition exp))
	((if? exp) (analyze-if exp))
	((lambda? exp) (analyze-lambda exp))
	((begin? exp) (analyze-sequence (begin-actions exp)))
	((cond? exp) (analyze (cond-&gt;if exp)))
	((application? exp) (analyze-application exp))
	(else
	 (error "Unknown expression type &#x2013; ANALYZE" exp))))
</p>

<p>
   Here is the simplest syntactic analysis procedure, which handles
self-evaluating expressions.  It returns an execution procedure that
ignores its environment argument and just returns the expression:
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-self-evaluating exp)
  (lambda (env) exp))
</p>

<p>
   For a quoted expression, we can gain a little efficiency by
extracting the text of the quotation only once, in the analysis phase,
rather than in the execution phase.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-quoted exp)
  (let ((qval (text-of-quotation exp)))
    (lambda (env) qval)))
</p>

<p>
   Looking up a variable value must still be done in the execution
phase, since this depends upon knowing the environment.(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-variable exp)
  (lambda (env) (lookup-variable-value exp env)))
</p>

<p>
   `Analyze-assignment' also must defer actually setting the variable
until the execution, when the environment has been supplied.  However,
the fact that the `assignment-value' expression can be analyzed
(recursively) during analysis is a major gain in efficiency, because
the `assignment-value' expression will now be analyzed only once.  The
same holds true for definitions.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-assignment exp)
  (let ((var (assignment-variable exp))
	(vproc (analyze (assignment-value exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (set-variable-value! var (vproc env) env)
      'ok)))
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-definition exp)
  (let ((var (definition-variable exp))
	(vproc (analyze (definition-value exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (define-variable! var (vproc env) env)
      'ok)))
</p>

<p>
   For `if' expressions, we extract and analyze the predicate,
consequent, and alternative at analysis time.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-if exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (if-predicate exp)))
	(cproc (analyze (if-consequent exp)))
	(aproc (analyze (if-alternative exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (if (true? (pproc env))
	  (cproc env)
	  (aproc env)))))
</p>

<p>
   Analyzing a `lambda' expression also achieves a major gain in
efficiency: We analyze the `lambda' body only once, even though
procedures resulting from evaluation of the `lambda' may be applied
many times.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-lambda exp)
  (let ((vars (lambda-parameters exp))
	(bproc (analyze-sequence (lambda-body exp))))
    (lambda (env) (make-procedure vars bproc env))))
</p>

<p>
   Analysis of a sequence of expressions (as in a `begin' or the body
of a `lambda' expression) is more involved.(3) Each expression in the
sequence is analyzed, yielding an execution procedure.  These execution
procedures are combined to produce an execution procedure that takes an
environment as argument and sequentially calls each individual execution
procedure with the environment as argument.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (sequentially proc1 proc2)
    (lambda (env) (proc1 env) (proc2 env)))
  (define (loop first-proc rest-procs)
    (if (null? rest-procs)
	first-proc
	(loop (sequentially first-proc (car rest-procs))
	      (cdr rest-procs))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
	(error "Empty sequence &#x2013; ANALYZE"))
    (loop (car procs) (cdr procs))))
</p>

<p>
   To analyze an application, we analyze the operator and operands and
construct an execution procedure that calls the operator execution
procedure (to obtain the actual procedure to be applied) and the
operand execution procedures (to obtain the actual arguments).  We then
pass these to `execute-application', which is the analog of `apply' in
section *Note 4-1-1::.  `Execute-application' differs from `apply' in
that the procedure body for a compound procedure has already been
analyzed, so there is no need to do further analysis.  Instead, we just
call the execution procedure for the body on the extended environment.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-application exp)
  (let ((fproc (analyze (operator exp)))
	(aprocs (map analyze (operands exp))))
    (lambda (env)
      (execute-application (fproc env)
			   (map (lambda (aproc) (aproc env))
				aprocs)))))
</p>

<p>
(define (execute-application proc args)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? proc)
	 (apply-primitive-procedure proc args))
	((compound-procedure? proc)
	 ((procedure-body proc)
	  (extend-environment (procedure-parameters proc)
			      args
			      (procedure-environment proc))))
	(else
	 (error
	  "Unknown procedure type &#x2013; EXECUTE-APPLICATION"
	  proc))))
</p>

<p>
   Our new evaluator uses the same data structures, syntax procedures,
and run-time support procedures as in sections *Note 4-1-2::, *Note
4-1-3::, and *Note 4-1-4::.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.22:</b> Extend the evaluator in this section to support
the special form `let'.  (See *Note Exercise 4-6::.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.23:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't understand why
`analyze-sequence' needs to be so complicated.  All the other
analysis procedures are straightforward transformations of the
corresponding evaluation procedures (or `eval' clauses) in section
*Note 4-1-1::.  She expected `analyze-sequence' to look like this:
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (execute-sequence procs env)
    (cond ((null? (cdr procs)) ((car procs) env))
	  (else ((car procs) env)
		(execute-sequence (cdr procs) env))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
	(error "Empty sequence &#x2013; ANALYZE"))
    (lambda (env) (execute-sequence procs env))))
</p>

<p>
Eva Lu Ator explains to Alyssa that the version in the text does
more of the work of evaluating a sequence at analysis time.
Alyssa's sequence-execution procedure, rather than having the
calls to the individual execution procedures built in, loops
through the procedures in order to call them: In effect, although
the individual expressions in the sequence have been analyzed, the
sequence itself has not been.
</p>

<p>
Compare the two versions of `analyze-sequence'.  For example,
consider the common case (typical of procedure bodies) where the
sequence has just one expression.  What work will the execution
procedure produced by Alyssa's program do?  What about the
execution procedure produced by the program in the text above?
How do the two versions compare for a sequence with two
expressions?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.24:</b> Design and carry out some experiments to compare
the speed of the original metacircular evaluator with the version
in this section.  Use your results to estimate the fraction of time
that is spent in analysis versus execution for various procedures.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Now that we have an evaluator expressed as a Lisp program, we can
experiment with alternative choices in language design simply by
modifying the evaluator.  Indeed, new languages are often invented by
first writing an evaluator that embeds the new language within an
existing high-level language.  For example, if we wish to discuss some
aspect of a proposed modification to Lisp with another member of the
Lisp community, we can supply an evaluator that embodies the change.
The recipient can then experiment with the new evaluator and send back
comments as further modifications.  Not only does the high-level
implementation base make it easier to test and debug the evaluator; in
addition, the embedding enables the designer to snarf(1) features from
the underlying language, just as our embedded Lisp evaluator uses
primitives and control structure from the underlying Lisp.  Only later
(if ever) need the designer go to the trouble of building a complete
implementation in a low-level language or in hardware.  In this section
and the next we explore some variations on Scheme that provide
significant additional expressive power.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<hr />

<p>
In section *Note 1-1::, where we began our discussion of models of
evaluation, we noted that Scheme is an "applicative-order" language,
namely, that all the arguments to Scheme procedures are evaluated when
the procedure is applied.  In contrast, "normal-order" languages delay
evaluation of procedure arguments until the actual argument values are
needed.  Delaying evaluation of procedure arguments until the last
possible moment (e.g., until they are required by a primitive
operation) is called evaluation "lazy evaluation".(1)  Consider the
procedure
</p>

<p>
(define (try a b)
  (if (= a 0) 1 b))
</p>

<p>
   Evaluating `(try 0 (/ 1 0))' generates an error in Scheme.  With lazy
evaluation, there would be no error.  Evaluating the expression would
return 1, because the argument `(/ 1 0)' would never be evaluated.
</p>

<p>
   An example that exploits lazy evaluation is the definition of a
procedure `unless'
</p>

<p>
(define (unless condition usual-value exceptional-value)
  (if condition exceptional-value usual-value))
</p>

<p>
that can be used in expressions such as
</p>

<p>
(unless (= b 0)
	(/ a b)
	(begin (display "exception: returning 0")
	       0))
</p>

<p>
   This won't work in an applicative-order language because both the
usual value and the exceptional value will be evaluated before `unless'
is called (compare *Note Exercise 1-6::).  An advantage of lazy
evaluation is that some procedures, such as `unless', can do useful
computation even if evaluation of some of their arguments would produce
errors or would not terminate.
</p>

<p>
   If the body of a procedure is entered before an argument has been
evaluated we say that the procedure is "non-strict" in that argument.
If the argument is evaluated before the body of the procedure is
entered we say that the procedure is "strict" in that argument.(2)  In
a purely applicative-order language, all procedures are strict in each
argument.  In a purely normal-order language, all compound procedures
are non-strict in each argument, and primitive procedures may be either
strict or non-strict.  There are also languages (see *Note Exercise
4-31::) that give programmers detailed control over the strictness of
the procedures they define.
</p>

<p>
   A striking example of a procedure that can usefully be made
non-strict is `cons' (or, in general, almost any constructor for data
structures).  One can do useful computation, combining elements to form
data structures and operating on the resulting data structures, even if
the values of the elements are not known.  It makes perfect sense, for
instance, to compute the length of a list without knowing the values of
the individual elements in the list.  We will exploit this idea in
section *Note 4-2-3:: to implement the streams of *Note Chapter 3:: as
lists formed of non-strict `cons' pairs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.25:</b> Suppose that (in ordinary applicative-order
Scheme) we define `unless' as shown above and then define
`factorial' in terms of `unless' as
</p>

<p>
(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
	  (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
	  1))
</p>

<p>
What happens if we attempt to evaluate `(factorial 5)'?  Will our
definitions work in a normal-order language?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.26:</b> Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker disagree over
the importance of lazy evaluation for implementing things such as
`unless'.  Ben points out that it's possible to implement `unless'
in applicative order as a special form.  Alyssa counters that, if
one did that, `unless' would be merely syntax, not a procedure
that could be used in conjunction with higher-order procedures.
Fill in the details on both sides of the argument.  Show how to
implement `unless' as a derived expression (like `cond' or `let'),
and give an example of a situation where it might be useful to
have `unless' available as a procedure, rather than as a special
form.

<p>
   (1) The difference between the "lazy" terminology and the
"normal-order" terminology is somewhat fuzzy.  Generally, "lazy" refers
to the mechanisms of particular evaluators, while "normal-order" refers
to the semantics of languages, independent of any particular evaluation
strategy.  But this is not a hard-and-fast distinction, and the two
terminologies are often used interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
   (2) The "strict" versus "non-strict" terminology means essentially
the same thing as "applicative-order" versus "normal-order," except
that it refers to individual procedures and arguments rather than to
the language as a whole.  At a conference on programming languages you
might hear someone say, "The normal-order language Hassle has certain
strict primitives.  Other procedures take their arguments by lazy
evaluation."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<hr />

<p>
In this section we will implement a normal-order language that is the
same as Scheme except that compound procedures are non-strict in each
argument.  Primitive procedures will still be strict.  It is not
difficult to modify the evaluator of section *Note 4-1-1:: so that the
language it interprets behaves this way.  Almost all the required
changes center around procedure application.
</p>

<p>
   The basic idea is that, when applying a procedure, the interpreter
must determine which arguments are to be evaluated and which are to be
delayed.  The delayed arguments are not evaluated; instead, they are
transformed into objects called "thunks".(1) The thunk must contain the
information required to produce the value of the argument when it is
needed, as if it had been evaluated at the time of the application.
Thus, the thunk must contain the argument expression and the
environment in which the procedure application is being evaluated.
</p>

<p>
   The process of evaluating the expression in a thunk is called "forcing".(2)
In general, a thunk will be forced only when its value is needed: when
it is passed to a primitive procedure that will use the value of the
thunk; when it is the value of a predicate of a conditional; and when
it is the value of an operator that is about to be applied as a
procedure.  One design choice we have available is whether or not to "memoize"
thunks, as we did with delayed objects in section *Note 3-5-1::.  With
memoization, the first time a thunk is forced, it stores the value that
is computed.  Subsequent forcings simply return the stored value
without repeating the computation.  We'll make our interpreter memoize,
because this is more efficient for many applications.  There are tricky
considerations here, however.(3)
</p>

<p>
Modifying the evaluator
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The main difference between the lazy evaluator and the one in section
*Note 4-1:: is in the handling of procedure applications in `eval' and
`apply'.
</p>

<p>
The `application?' clause of `eval' becomes
</p>

<p>
((application? exp)
 (apply (actual-value (operator exp) env)
	(operands exp)
	env))
</p>

<p>
   This is almost the same as the `application?' clause of `eval' in
section *Note 4-1-1::.  For lazy evaluation, however, we call `apply'
with the operand expressions, rather than the arguments produced by
evaluating them.  Since we will need the environment to construct
thunks if the arguments are to be delayed, we must pass this as well.
We still evaluate the operator, because `apply' needs the actual
procedure to be applied in order to dispatch on its type (primitive
versus compound) and apply it.
</p>

<p>
Whenever we need the actual value of an expression, we use
</p>

<p>
(define (actual-value exp env)
  (force-it (eval exp env)))
</p>

<p>
instead of just `eval', so that if the expression's value is a thunk, it
will be forced.
</p>

<p>
   Our new version of `apply' is also almost the same as the version in
section *Note 4-1-1::.  The difference is that `eval' has passed in
unevaluated operand expressions: For primitive procedures (which are
strict), we evaluate all the arguments before applying the primitive;
for compound procedures (which are non-strict) we delay all the
arguments before applying the procedure.
</p>

<p>
(define (apply procedure arguments env)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)
	 (apply-primitive-procedure
	  procedure
	  (list-of-arg-values arguments env)))  ; changed
	((compound-procedure? procedure)
	 (eval-sequence
	  (procedure-body procedure)
	  (extend-environment
	   (procedure-parameters procedure)
	   (list-of-delayed-args arguments env) ; changed
	   (procedure-environment procedure))))
	(else
	 (error
	  "Unknown procedure type &#x2013; APPLY" procedure))))
</p>

<p>
   The procedures that process the arguments are just like
`list-of-values' from section *Note 4-1-1::, except that
`list-of-delayed-args' delays the arguments instead of evaluating them,
and `list-of-arg-values' uses `actual-value' instead of `eval':
</p>

<p>
(define (list-of-arg-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (actual-value (first-operand exps) env)
	    (list-of-arg-values (rest-operands exps)
				env))))
</p>

<p>
(define (list-of-delayed-args exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (cons (delay-it (first-operand exps) env)
	    (list-of-delayed-args (rest-operands exps)
				  env))))
</p>

<p>
   The other place we must change the evaluator is in the handling of
`if', where we must use `actual-value' instead of `eval' to get the
value of the predicate expression before testing whether it is true or
false:
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-if exp env)
  (if (true? (actual-value (if-predicate exp) env))
      (eval (if-consequent exp) env)
      (eval (if-alternative exp) env)))
</p>

<p>
   Finally, we must change the `driver-loop' procedure (section *Note
4-1-4::) to use `actual-value' instead of `eval', so that if a delayed
value is propagated back to the read-eval-print loop, it will be forced
before being printed.  We also change the prompts to indicate that this
is the lazy evaluator:
</p>

<p>
(define input-prompt ";;; L-Eval input:")
(define output-prompt ";;; L-Eval value:")
</p>

<p>
(define (driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let ((input (read)))
    (let ((output
	   (actual-value input the-global-environment)))
      (announce-output output-prompt)
      (user-print output)))
  (driver-loop))
</p>

<p>
   With these changes made, we can start the evaluator and test it.  The
successful evaluation of the `try' expression discussed in section
*Note 4-2-1:: indicates that the interpreter is performing lazy
evaluation:
</p>

<p>
(define the-global-environment (setup-environment))
</p>

<p>
(driver-loop)
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(define (try a b)
  (if (= a 0) 1 b))
;;; L-Eval value:
ok
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(try 0 (/ 1 0))
;;; L-Eval value:
1
</p>

<p>
Representing thunks
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Our evaluator must arrange to create thunks when procedures are applied
to arguments and to force these thunks later.  A thunk must package an
expression together with the environment, so that the argument can be
produced later.  To force the thunk, we simply extract the expression
and environment from the thunk and evaluate the expression in the
environment.  We use `actual-value' rather than `eval' so that in case
the value of the expression is itself a thunk, we will force that, and
so on, until we reach something that is not a thunk:
</p>

<p>
(define (force-it obj)
  (if (thunk? obj)
      (actual-value (thunk-exp obj) (thunk-env obj))
      obj))
</p>

<p>
   One easy way to package an expression with an environment is to make
a list containing the expression and the environment.  Thus, we create
a thunk as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (delay-it exp env)
  (list 'thunk exp env))
</p>

<p>
(define (thunk? obj)
  (tagged-list? obj 'thunk))
</p>

<p>
(define (thunk-exp thunk) (cadr thunk))
</p>

<p>
(define (thunk-env thunk) (caddr thunk))
</p>

<p>
   Actually, what we want for our interpreter is not quite this, but
rather thunks that have been memoized.  When a thunk is forced, we will
turn it into an evaluated thunk by replacing the stored expression with
its value and changing the `thunk' tag so that it can be recognized as
already evaluated.(4)
</p>

<p>
(define (evaluated-thunk? obj)
  (tagged-list? obj 'evaluated-thunk))
</p>

<p>
(define (thunk-value evaluated-thunk) (cadr evaluated-thunk))
</p>

<p>
(define (force-it obj)
  (cond ((thunk? obj)
	 (let ((result (actual-value
			(thunk-exp obj)
			(thunk-env obj))))
	   (set-car! obj 'evaluated-thunk)
	   (set-car! (cdr obj) result)  ; replace `exp' with its value
	   (set-cdr! (cdr obj) '())     ; forget unneeded `env'
	   result))
	((evaluated-thunk? obj)
	 (thunk-value obj))
	(else obj)))
</p>

<p>
   Notice that the same `delay-it' procedure works both with and without
memoization.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.27:</b> Suppose we type in the following definitions to
the lazy evaluator:
</p>

<p>
(define count 0)
</p>

<p>
(define (id x)
  (set! count (+ count 1))
  x)
</p>

<p>
Give the missing values in the following sequence of interactions,
and explain your answers.(5)
</p>

<p>
(define w (id (id 10)))
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
w
;;; L-Eval value:
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.28:</b> `Eval' uses `actual-value' rather than `eval' to
evaluate the operator before passing it to `apply', in order to
force the value of the operator.  Give an example that
demonstrates the need for this forcing.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.29:</b> Exhibit a program that you would expect to run
much more slowly without memoization than with memoization.  Also,
consider the following interaction, where the `id' procedure is
defined as in *Note Exercise 4-27:: and `count' starts at 0:
</p>

<p>
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(square (id 10))
;;; L-Eval value:
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
&lt;RESPONSE&gt;
</p>

<p>
Give the responses both when the evaluator memoizes and when it
does not.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.30:</b> Cy D. Fect, a reformed C programmer, is worried
that some side effects may never take place, because the lazy
evaluator doesn't force the expressions in a sequence.  Since the
value of an expression in a sequence other than the last one is
not used (the expression is there only for its effect, such as
assigning to a variable or printing), there can be no subsequent
use of this value (e.g., as an argument to a primitive procedure)
that will cause it to be forced.  Cy thus thinks that when
evaluating sequences, we must force all expressions in the
sequence except the final one.  He proposes to modify
`eval-sequence' from section *Note 4-1-1:: to use `actual-value'
rather than `eval':
</p>

<p>
(define (eval-sequence exps env)
  (cond ((last-exp? exps) (eval (first-exp exps) env))
	(else (actual-value (first-exp exps) env)
	      (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) env))))
</p>

<p>
a. Ben Bitdiddle thinks Cy is wrong.  He shows Cy the `for-each'
   procedure described in *Note Exercise 2-23::, which gives an
   important example of a sequence with side effects:
</p>

<p>
(define (for-each proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      'done
      (begin (proc (car items))
	     (for-each proc (cdr items)))))
</p>

<p>
He claims that the evaluator in the text (with the original
`eval-sequence') handles this correctly:
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
	  (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88
;;; L-Eval value:
done
</p>

<p>
Explain why Ben is right about the behavior of `for-each'.
</p>

<p>
b. Cy agrees that Ben is right about the `for-each' example, but
   says that that's not the kind of program he was thinking
   about when he proposed his change to `eval-sequence'.  He
   defines the following two procedures in the lazy evaluator:
</p>

<p>
(define (p1 x)
  (set! x (cons x '(2)))
  x)
</p>

<p>
(define (p2 x)
  (define (p e)
    e
    x)
  (p (set! x (cons x '(2)))))
</p>

<p>
What are the values of `(p1 1)' and `(p2 1)' with the original
`eval-sequence'?  What would the values be with Cy's proposed
change to `eval-sequence'?
</p>

<p>
c. Cy also points out that changing `eval-sequence' as he
   proposes does not affect the behavior of the example in part
   a.  Explain why this is true.
</p>

<p>
d. How do you think sequences ought to be treated in the lazy
   evaluator?  Do you like Cy's approach, the approach in the
   text, or some other approach?
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.31:</b> The approach taken in this section is somewhat
unpleasant, because it makes an incompatible change to Scheme.  It
might be nicer to implement lazy evaluation as an "upward-compatible
extension", that is, so that ordinary Scheme programs will work as
before.  We can do this by extending the syntax of procedure
declarations to let the user control whether or not arguments are
to be delayed.  While we're at it, we may as well also give the
user the choice between delaying with and without memoization.
For example, the definition
</p>

<p>
(define (f a (b lazy) c (d lazy-memo))
  &#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
would define `f' to be a procedure of four arguments, where the
first and third arguments are evaluated when the procedure is
called, the second argument is delayed, and the fourth argument is
both delayed and memoized.  Thus, ordinary procedure definitions
will produce the same behavior as ordinary Scheme, while adding
the `lazy-memo' declaration to each parameter of every compound
procedure will produce the behavior of the lazy evaluator defined
in this section. Design and implement the changes required to
produce such an extension to Scheme.  You will have to implement
new syntax procedures to handle the new syntax for `define'.  You
must also arrange for `eval' or `apply' to determine when
arguments are to be delayed, and to force or delay arguments
accordingly, and you must arrange for forcing to memoize or not,
as appropriate.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) The word "thunk" was invented by an informal working group that
was discussing the implementation of call-by-name in Algol 60.  They
observed that most of the analysis of ("thinking about") the expression
could be done at compile time; thus, at run time, the expression would
already have been "thunk" about (Ingerman et al. 1960).
</p>

<p>
   (2) This is analogous to the use of `force' on the delayed objects
that were introduced in *Note Chapter 3:: to represent streams.  The
critical difference between what we are doing here and what we did in
*Note Chapter 3:: is that we are building delaying and forcing into the
evaluator, and thus making this uniform and automatic throughout the
language.
</p>

<p>
   (3) Lazy evaluation combined with memoization is sometimes referred
to as "call-by-need" argument passing, in contrast to "call-by-name"
argument passing.  (Call-by-name, introduced in Algol 60, is similar to
non-memoized lazy evaluation.)  As language designers, we can build our
evaluator to memoize, not to memoize, or leave this an option for
programmers (*Note Exercise 4-31::).  As you might expect from *Note
Chapter 3::, these choices raise issues that become both subtle and
confusing in the presence of assignments.  (See *Note Exercise 4-27::
and *Note Exercise 4-29::.)  An excellent article by Clinger (1982)
attempts to clarify the multiple dimensions of confusion that arise
here.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Notice that we also erase the `env' from the thunk once the
expression's value has been computed.  This makes no difference in the
values returned by the interpreter.  It does help save space, however,
because removing the reference from the thunk to the `env' once it is
no longer needed allows this structure to be "garbage-collected" and
its space recycled, as we will discuss in section *Note 5-3::.
</p>

<p>
   Similarly, we could have allowed unneeded environments in the
memoized delayed objects of section *Note 3-5-1:: to be
garbage-collected, by having `memo-proc' do something like `(set! proc
'())' to discard the procedure `proc' (which includes the environment
in which the `delay' was evaluated) after storing its value.
</p>

<p>
   (5) This exercise demonstrates that the interaction between lazy
evaluation and side effects can be very confusing.  This is just what
you might expect from the discussion in *Note Chapter 3::.

<div id="outline-container-org9264213" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9264213"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Streams as Lazy Lists</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<hr />

<p>
In section *Note 3-5-1::, we showed how to implement streams as delayed
lists.  We introduced special forms `delay' and `cons-stream', which
allowed us to construct a "promise" to compute the `cdr' of a stream,
without actually fulfilling that promise until later.  We could use
this general technique of introducing special forms whenever we need
more control over the evaluation process, but this is awkward.  For one
thing, a special form is not a first-class object like a procedure, so
we cannot use it together with higher-order procedures.(1)
Additionally, we were forced to create streams as a new kind of data
object similar but not identical to lists, and this required us to
reimplement many ordinary list operations (`map', `append', and so on)
for use with streams.
</p>

<p>
   With lazy evaluation, streams and lists can be identical, so there
is no need for special forms or for separate list and stream
operations.  All we need to do is to arrange matters so that `cons' is
non-strict.  One way to accomplish this is to extend the lazy evaluator
to allow for non-strict primitives, and to implement `cons' as one of
these.  An easier way is to recall (section *Note 2-1-3::) that there
is no fundamental need to implement `cons' as a primitive at all.
Instead, we can represent pairs as procedures:(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (cons x y)
  (lambda (m) (m x y)))
</p>

<p>
(define (car z)
  (z (lambda (p q) p)))
</p>

<p>
(define (cdr z)
  (z (lambda (p q) q)))
</p>

<p>
   In terms of these basic operations, the standard definitions of the
list operations will work with infinite lists (streams) as well as
finite ones, and the stream operations can be implemented as list
operations.  Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>
(define (list-ref items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (list-ref (cdr items) (- n 1))))
</p>

<p>
(define (map proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      '()
      (cons (proc (car items))
	    (map proc (cdr items)))))
</p>

<p>
(define (scale-list items factor)
  (map (lambda (x) (* x factor))
       items))
</p>

<p>
(define (add-lists list1 list2)
  (cond ((null? list1) list2)
	((null? list2) list1)
	(else (cons (+ (car list1) (car list2))
		    (add-lists (cdr list1) (cdr list2))))))
</p>

<p>
(define ones (cons 1 ones))
</p>

<p>
(define integers (cons 1 (add-lists ones integers)))
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(list-ref integers 17)
;;; L-Eval value:
18
</p>

<p>
   Note that these lazy lists are even lazier than the streams of *Note
Chapter 3::: The `car' of the list, as well as the `cdr', is
delayed.(3)  In fact, even accessing the `car' or `cdr' of a lazy pair
need not force the value of a list element.  The value will be forced
only when it is really needed - e.g., for use as the argument of a
primitive, or to be printed as an answer.
</p>

<p>
   Lazy pairs also help with the problem that arose with streams in
section *Note 3-5-4::, where we found that formulating stream models of
systems with loops may require us to sprinkle our programs with
explicit `delay' operations, beyond the ones supplied by `cons-stream'.
With lazy evaluation, all arguments to procedures are delayed
uniformly.  For instance, we can implement procedures to integrate
lists and solve differential equations as we originally intended in
section *Note 3-5-4:::
</p>

<p>
(define (integral integrand initial-value dt)
  (define int
    (cons initial-value
	  (add-lists (scale-list integrand dt)
		    int)))
  int)
</p>

<p>
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral dy y0 dt))
  (define dy (map f y))
  y)
</p>

<p>
;;; L-Eval input:
(list-ref (solve (lambda (x) x) 1 0.001) 1000)
;;; L-Eval value:
2.716924
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.32:</b> Give some examples that illustrate the difference
between the streams of *Note Chapter 3:: and the "lazier" lazy
lists described in this section.  How can you take advantage of
this extra laziness?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.33:</b> Ben Bitdiddle tests the lazy list implementation
given above by evaluating the expression
</p>

<p>
(car '(a b c))
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, this produces an error.  After some thought, he
realizes that the "lists" obtained by reading in quoted
expressions are different from the lists manipulated by the new
definitions of `cons', `car', and `cdr'.  Modify the evaluator's
treatment of quoted expressions so that quoted lists typed at the
driver loop will produce true lazy lists.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.34:</b> Modify the driver loop for the evaluator so that
lazy pairs and lists will print in some reasonable way.  (What are
you going to do about infinite lists?)  You may also need to modify
the representation of lazy pairs so that the evaluator can
identify them in order to print them.

   (2) This is the procedural representation described in *Note
Exercise 2-4::.  Essentially any procedural representation (e.g., a
message-passing implementation) would do as well.  Notice that we can
install these definitions in the lazy evaluator simply by typing them
at the driver loop.  If we had originally included `cons', `car', and
`cdr' as primitives in the global environment, they will be redefined.
(Also see *Note Exercise 4-33:: and *Note Exercise 4-34::.)

of list structures, not just sequences.  Hughes 1990 discusses some

<h2 id="org6a7b3fe"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Variations on a Scheme - Nondeterministic Computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In this section, we extend the Scheme evaluator to support a programming
paradigm called "nondeterministic computing" by building into the
evaluator a facility to support automatic search.  This is a much more
profound change to the language than the introduction of lazy
evaluation in section *Note 4-2::.
</p>

<p>
   Nondeterministic computing, like stream processing, is useful for
"generate and test" applications.  Consider the task of starting with
two lists of positive integers and finding a pair of integers&#x2013;one from
the first list and one from the second list&#x2013;whose sum is prime.  We
saw how to handle this with finite sequence operations in section *Note
2-2-3:: and with infinite streams in section *Note 3-5-3::.  Our
approach was to generate the sequence of all possible pairs and filter
these to select the pairs whose sum is prime.  Whether we actually
generate the entire sequence of pairs first as in *Note Chapter 2::, or
interleave the generating and filtering as in *Note Chapter 3::, is
immaterial to the essential image of how the computation is organized.
</p>

<p>
   The nondeterministic approach evokes a different image.  Imagine
simply that we choose (in some way) a number from the first list and a
number from the second list and require (using some mechanism) that
their sum be prime.  This is expressed by following procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (prime-sum-pair list1 list2)
  (let ((a (an-element-of list1))
	(b (an-element-of list2)))
    (require (prime? (+ a b)))
    (list a b)))
</p>

<p>
   It might seem as if this procedure merely restates the problem,
rather than specifying a way to solve it.  Nevertheless, this is a
legitimate nondeterministic program.(1)
</p>

<p>
   The key idea here is that expressions in a nondeterministic language
can have more than one possible value.  For instance, `an-element-of'
might return any element of the given list.  Our nondeterministic
program evaluator will work by automatically choosing a possible value
and keeping track of the choice.  If a subsequent requirement is not
met, the evaluator will try a different choice, and it will keep trying
new choices until the evaluation succeeds, or until we run out of
choices.  Just as the lazy evaluator freed the programmer from the
details of how values are delayed and forced, the nondeterministic
program evaluator will free the programmer from the details of how
choices are made.
</p>

<p>
   It is instructive to contrast the different images of time evoked by
nondeterministic evaluation and stream processing.  Stream processing
uses lazy evaluation to decouple the time when the stream of possible
answers is assembled from the time when the actual stream elements are
produced.  The evaluator supports the illusion that all the possible
answers are laid out before us in a timeless sequence.  With
nondeterministic evaluation, an expression represents the exploration
of a set of possible worlds, each determined by a set of choices.  Some
of the possible worlds lead to dead ends, while others have useful
values.  The nondeterministic program evaluator supports the illusion
that time branches, and that our programs have different possible
execution histories.  When we reach a dead end, we can revisit a
previous choice point and proceed along a different branch.
</p>

<p>
   The nondeterministic program evaluator implemented below is called
the `amb' evaluator because it is based on a new special form called
`amb'.  We can type the above definition of `prime-sum-pair' at the
`amb' evaluator driver loop (along with definitions of `prime?',
`an-element-of', and `require') and run the procedure as follows:
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(prime-sum-pair '(1 3 5 8) '(20 35 110))
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(3 20)
</p>

<p>
   The value returned was obtained after the evaluator repeatedly chose
elements from each of the lists, until a successful choice was made.
</p>

<p>
   Section *Note 4-3-1:: introduces `amb' and explains how it supports
nondeterminism through the evaluator's automatic search mechanism.
Section *Note 4-3-2:: presents examples of nondeterministic programs,
and section *Note 4-3-3:: gives the details of how to implement the
`amb' evaluator by modifying the ordinary Scheme evaluator.
</p>

</p>

<p>
   (1) We assume that we have previously defined a procedure `prime?'
that tests whether numbers are prime.  Even with `prime?' defined, the
`prime-sum-pair' procedure may look suspiciously like the unhelpful
"pseudo-Lisp" attempt to define the square-root function, which we
described at the beginning of section *Note 1-1-7::.  In fact, a
square-root procedure along those lines can actually be formulated as a
nondeterministic program.  By incorporating a search mechanism into the
evaluator, we are eroding the distinction between purely declarative
descriptions and imperative specifications of how to compute answers.
We'll go even farther in this direction in section *Note 4-4::.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<hr />

<p>
To extend Scheme to support nondeterminism, we introduce a new special
form called `amb'.(1) The expression
</p>

<p>
(amb &lt;E<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;E<sub>2</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;E<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
returns the value of one of the n expressions &lt;E<sub>I</sub>&gt; "ambiguously."  For
example, the expression
</p>

<p>
(list (amb 1 2 3) (amb 'a 'b))
</p>

<p>
can have six possible values:
</p>

<p>
`(1 a)' `(1 b)' `(2 a)' `(2 b)' `(3 a)' `(3 b)'
</p>

<p>
`Amb' with a single choice produces an ordinary (single) value.
</p>

<p>
   `Amb' with no choices&#x2013;the expression `(amb)'&#x2013;is an expression with
no acceptable values.  Operationally, we can think of `(amb)' as an
expression that when evaluated causes the computation to "fail": The
computation aborts and no value is produced.  Using this idea, we can
express the requirement that a particular predicate expression `p' must
be true as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (require p)
  (if (not p) (amb)))
</p>

<p>
   With `amb' and `require', we can implement the `an-element-of'
procedure used above:
</p>

<p>
(define (an-element-of items)
  (require (not (null? items)))
  (amb (car items) (an-element-of (cdr items))))
</p>

<p>
   `An-element-of' fails if the list is empty.  Otherwise it ambiguously
returns either the first element of the list or an element chosen from
the rest of the list.
</p>

<p>
   We can also express infinite ranges of choices.  The following
procedure potentially returns any integer greater than or equal to some
given n:
</p>

<p>
(define (an-integer-starting-from n)
  (amb n (an-integer-starting-from (+ n 1))))
</p>

<p>
   This is like the stream procedure `integers-starting-from' described
in section *Note 3-5-2::, but with an important difference: The stream
procedure returns an object that represents the sequence of all
integers beginning with n, whereas the `amb' procedure returns a single
integer.(2)
</p>

<p>
   Abstractly, we can imagine that evaluating an `amb' expression
causes time to split into branches, where the computation continues on
each branch with one of the possible values of the expression.  We say
that `amb' represents a "nondeterministic choice point".  If we had a
machine with a sufficient number of processors that could be
dynamically allocated, we could implement the search in a
straightforward way.  Execution would proceed as in a sequential
machine, until an `amb' expression is encountered.  At this point, more
processors would be allocated and initialized to continue all of the
parallel executions implied by the choice.  Each processor would proceed
sequentially as if it were the only choice, until it either terminates
by encountering a failure, or it further subdivides, or it finishes.(3)
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, if we have a machine that can execute only one
process (or a few concurrent processes), we must consider the
alternatives sequentially.  One could imagine modifying an evaluator to
pick at random a branch to follow whenever it encounters a choice
point.  Random choice, however, can easily lead to failing values.  We
might try running the evaluator over and over, making random choices
and hoping to find a non-failing value, but it is better to "systematically
search" all possible execution paths.  The `amb' evaluator that we will
develop and work with in this section implements a systematic search as
follows: When the evaluator encounters an application of `amb', it
initially selects the first alternative.  This selection may itself
lead to a further choice.  The evaluator will always initially choose
the first alternative at each choice point.  If a choice results in a
failure, then the evaluator automagically(4) "backtracks" to the most
recent choice point and tries the next alternative.  If it runs out of
alternatives at any choice point, the evaluator will back up to the
previous choice point and resume from there.  This process leads to a
search strategy known as "depth-first search" or backtracking
"chronological backtracking".(5)
</p>

<p>
Driver loop
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The driver loop for the `amb' evaluator has some unusual properties.  It
reads an expression and prints the value of the first non-failing
execution, as in the `prime-sum-pair' example shown above.  If we want
to see the value of the next successful execution, we can ask the
interpreter to backtrack and attempt to generate a second non-failing
execution.  This is signaled by typing the symbol `try-again'.  If any
expression except `try-again' is given, the interpreter will start a
new problem, discarding the unexplored alternatives in the previous
problem.  Here is a sample interaction:
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(prime-sum-pair '(1 3 5 8) '(20 35 110))
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(3 20)
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
try-again
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(3 110)
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
try-again
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(8 35)
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
try-again
;;; There are no more values of
(prime-sum-pair (quote (1 3 5 8)) (quote (20 35 110)))
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(prime-sum-pair '(19 27 30) '(11 36 58))
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(30 11)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.35:</b> Write a procedure `an-integer-between' that
returns an integer between two given bounds.  This can be used to
implement a procedure that finds Pythagorean triples, i.e.,
triples of integers (i,j,k) between the given bounds such that i
&lt;= j and i<sup>2</sup> + j<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>2</sup>, as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
  (let ((i (an-integer-between low high)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
      (let ((k (an-integer-between j high)))
	(require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
	(list i j k)))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.36:</b> *Note Exercise 3-69:: discussed how to generate
the stream of <span class="underline">all</span> Pythagorean triples, with no upper bound on
the size of the integers to be searched.  Explain why simply
replacing `an-integer-between' by `an-integer-starting-from' in
the procedure in *Note Exercise 4-35:: is not an adequate way to
generate arbitrary Pythagorean triples.  Write a procedure that
actually will accomplish this.  (That is, write a procedure for
which repeatedly typing `try-again' would in principle eventually
generate all Pythagorean triples.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.37:</b> Ben Bitdiddle claims that the following method
for generating Pythagorean triples is more efficient than the one
in *Note Exercise 4-35::.  Is he correct?  (Hint: Consider the
number of possibilities that must be explored.)

      (let ((ksq (+ (* i i) (* j j))))
	(require (&gt;= hsq ksq))
	(let ((k (sqrt ksq)))
	  (require (integer? k))
	  (list i j k))))))

<p>
   (1) The idea of `amb' for nondeterministic programming was first
described in 1961 by John McCarthy (see McCarthy 1967).
</p>

<p>
   (2) In actuality, the distinction between nondeterministically
returning a single choice and returning all choices depends somewhat on
our point of view.  From the perspective of the code that uses the
value, the nondeterministic choice returns a single value.  From the
perspective of the programmer designing the code, the nondeterministic
choice potentially returns all possible values, and the computation
branches so that each value is investigated separately.
</p>

<p>
   (3) One might object that this is a hopelessly inefficient
mechanism.  It might require millions of processors to solve some
easily stated problem this way, and most of the time most of those
processors would be idle.  This objection should be taken in the
context of history.  Memory used to be considered just such an
expensive commodity.  In 1964 a megabyte of RAM cost about $400,000.
Now every personal computer has many megabytes of RAM, and most of the
time most of that RAM is unused.  It is hard to underestimate the cost
of mass-produced electronics.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Automagically: "Automatically, but in a way which, for some
reason (typically because it is too complicated, or too ugly, or
perhaps even too trivial), the speaker doesn't feel like explaining."
(Steele 1983, Raymond 1993)
</p>

<p>
   (5) [Footnote 4.47] The integration of automatic search strategies
into programming languages has had a long and checkered history.  The
first suggestions that nondeterministic algorithms might be elegantly
encoded in a programming language with search and automatic
backtracking came from Robert Floyd (1967).  Carl Hewitt (1969)
invented a programming language called Planner that explicitly
supported automatic chronological backtracking, providing for a
built-in depth-first search strategy.  Sussman, Winograd, and Charniak
(1971) implemented a subset of this language, called MicroPlanner,
which was used to support work in problem solving and robot planning.
Similar ideas, arising from logic and theorem proving, led to the
genesis in Edinburgh and Marseille of the elegant language Prolog
(which we will discuss in section *Note 4-4::).  After sufficient
frustration with automatic search, McDermott and Sussman (1972)
developed a language called Conniver, which included mechanisms for
placing the search strategy under programmer control.  This proved
unwieldy, however, and Sussman and Stallman (1975) found a more
tractable approach while investigating methods of symbolic analysis for
electrical circuits.  They developed a non-chronological backtracking
scheme that was based on tracing out the logical dependencies
connecting facts, a technique that has come to be known as "dependency-directed
backtracking".  Although their method was complex, it produced
reasonably efficient programs because it did little redundant search.
Doyle (1979) and McAllester (1978, 1980) generalized and clarified the
methods of Stallman and Sussman, developing a new paradigm for
formulating search that is now called "truth maintenance".  Modern
problem-solving systems all use some form of truth-maintenance system
as a substrate.  See Forbus and deKleer 1993 for a discussion of
elegant ways to build truth-maintenance systems and applications using
truth maintenance.  Zabih, McAllester, and Chapman 1987 describes a
nondeterministic extension to Scheme that is based on `amb'; it is
similar to the interpreter described in this section, but more
sophisticated, because it uses dependency-directed backtracking rather
than chronological backtracking.  Winston 1992 gives an introduction to
both kinds of backtracking.

used.  The advantage of nondeterministic programming is that we can

our programs at a higher level of abstraction.

Logic Puzzles
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The following puzzle (taken from Dinesman 1968) is typical of a large
class of simple logic puzzles:
</p>

<p>
Baker, Cooper, Fletcher, Miller, and Smith live on different
floors of an apartment house that contains only five floors.
Baker does not live on the top floor.  Cooper does not live on the
bottom floor.  Fletcher does not live on either the top or the
bottom floor.  Miller lives on a higher floor than does Cooper.
Smith does not live on a floor adjacent to Fletcher's.  Fletcher
does not live on a floor adjacent to Cooper's.  Where does
everyone live?
</p>

<p>
   We can determine who lives on each floor in a straightforward way by
enumerating all the possibilities and imposing the given
restrictions:(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (multiple-dwelling)
  (let ((baker (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
	(cooper (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
	(fletcher (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
	(miller (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
	(smith (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require
     (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith)))
    (require (not (= baker 5)))
    (require (not (= cooper 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 5)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 1)))
    (require (&gt; miller cooper))
    (require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
    (require (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
    (list (list 'baker baker)
	  (list 'cooper cooper)
	  (list 'fletcher fletcher)
	  (list 'miller miller)
	  (list 'smith smith))))
</p>

<p>
Evaluating the expression `(multiple-dwelling)' produces the result
</p>

<p>
((baker 3) (cooper 2) (fletcher 4) (miller 5) (smith 1))
</p>

<p>
   Although this simple procedure works, it is very slow.  *Note
Exercise 4-39:: and *Note Exercise 4-40:: discuss some possible
improvements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.38:</b> Modify the multiple-dwelling procedure to omit
the requirement that Smith and Fletcher do not live on adjacent
floors.  How many solutions are there to this modified puzzle?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.39:</b> Does the order of the restrictions in the
multiple-dwelling procedure affect the answer? Does it affect the
time to find an answer?  If you think it matters, demonstrate a
faster program obtained from the given one by reordering the
restrictions.  If you think it does not matter, argue your case.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.40:</b> In the multiple dwelling problem, how many sets
of assignments are there of people to floors, both before and
after the requirement that floor assignments be distinct?  It is
very inefficient to generate all possible assignments of people to
floors and then leave it to backtracking to eliminate them.  For
example, most of the restrictions depend on only one or two of the
person-floor variables, and can thus be imposed before floors have
been selected for all the people.  Write and demonstrate a much
more efficient nondeterministic procedure that solves this problem
based upon generating only those possibilities that are not already
ruled out by previous restrictions.  (Hint: This will require a
nest of `let' expressions.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.41:</b> Write an ordinary Scheme program to solve the
multiple dwelling puzzle.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.42:</b> Solve the following "Liars" puzzle (from Phillips
1934):
</p>

<p>
Five schoolgirls sat for an examination.  Their parents&#x2013;so they
thought&#x2013;showed an undue degree of interest in the result.  They
therefore agreed that, in writing home about the examination, each
girl should make one true statement and one untrue one.  The
following are the relevant passages from their letters:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Betty: "Kitty was second in the examination.  I was only
third."</li>

<li>Ethel: "You'll be glad to hear that I was on top.  Joan was
second."</li>

<li>Joan: "I was third, and poor old Ethel was bottom."</li>

<li>Kitty: "I came out second.  Mary was only fourth."</li>

<li>Mary: "I was fourth.  Top place was taken by Betty."</li>
</ul>


<p>
What in fact was the order in which the five girls were placed?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.43:</b> Use the `amb' evaluator to solve the following
puzzle:(2)
</p>

<p>
Mary Ann Moore's father has a yacht and so has each of his
four friends: Colonel Downing, Mr. Hall, Sir Barnacle Hood,

each has named his yacht after a daughter of one of the
others.  Sir Barnacle's yacht is the Gabrielle, Mr. Moore
owns the Lorna; Mr. Hall the Rosalind.  The Melissa, owned by
Colonel Downing, is named after Sir Barnacle's daughter.
Gabrielle's father owns the yacht that is named after Dr.
Parker's daughter.  Who is Lorna's father?
</p>

<p>
Try to write the program so that it runs efficiently (see *Note
Exercise 4-40::).  Also determine how many solutions there are if
we are not told that Mary Ann's last name is Moore.

Parsing natural language
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Programs designed to accept natural language as input usually start by
attempting to "parse" the input, that is, to match the input against
some grammatical structure.  For example, we might try to recognize
simple sentences consisting of an article followed by a noun followed
by a verb, such as "The cat eats."  To accomplish such an analysis, we
must be able to identify the parts of speech of individual words.  We
could start with some lists that classify various words:(3)
</p>

<p>
(define nouns '(noun student professor cat class))
</p>

<p>
(define verbs '(verb studies lectures eats sleeps))
</p>

<p>
(define articles '(article the a))
</p>

<p>
   We also need a "grammar", that is, a set of rules describing how
grammatical elements are composed from simpler elements.  A very simple
grammar might stipulate that a sentence always consists of two
pieces&#x2013;a noun phrase followed by a verb&#x2013;and that a noun phrase
consists of an article followed by a noun.  With this grammar, the
sentence "The cat eats" is parsed as follows:
</p>

<p>
(sentence (noun-phrase (article the) (noun cat))
	  (verb eats))
</p>

<p>
   We can generate such a parse with a simple program that has separate
procedures for each of the grammatical rules.  To parse a sentence, we
identify its two constituent pieces and return a list of these two
elements, tagged with the symbol `sentence':
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
	 (parse-noun-phrase)
	 (parse-word verbs)))
</p>

<p>
   A noun phrase, similarly, is parsed by finding an article followed
by a noun:
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-noun-phrase)
  (list 'noun-phrase
	(parse-word articles)
	(parse-word nouns)))
</p>

<p>
   At the lowest level, parsing boils down to repeatedly checking that
the next unparsed word is a member of the list of words for the
required part of speech.  To implement this, we maintain a global
variable `*unparsed*', which is the input that has not yet been parsed.
Each time we check a word, we require that `*unparsed*' must be
non-empty and that it should begin with a word from the designated
list.  If so, we remove that word from `*unparsed*' and return the word
together with its part of speech (which is found at the head of the
list):(4)
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-word word-list)
  (require (not (null? <b>unparsed</b>)))
  (require (memq (car <b>unparsed</b>) (cdr word-list)))
  (let ((found-word (car <b>unparsed</b>)))
    (set! <b>unparsed</b> (cdr <b>unparsed</b>))
    (list (car word-list) found-word)))
</p>

<p>
   To start the parsing, all we need to do is set `*unparsed*' to be the
entire input, try to parse a sentence, and check that nothing is left
over:
</p>

<p>
(define <b>unparsed</b> '())
</p>

<p>
(define (parse input)
  (set! <b>unparsed</b> input)
  (let ((sent (parse-sentence)))
    (require (null? <b>unparsed</b>))
    sent))
</p>

<p>
   We can now try the parser and verify that it works for our simple
test sentence:
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(parse '(the cat eats))
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(sentence (noun-phrase (article the) (noun cat)) (verb eats))
</p>

<p>
   The `amb' evaluator is useful here because it is convenient to
express the parsing constraints with the aid of `require'.  Automatic
search and backtracking really pay off, however, when we consider more
complex grammars where there are choices for how the units can be
decomposed.
</p>

<p>
Let's add to our grammar a list of prepositions:
</p>

<p>
(define prepositions '(prep for to in by with))
</p>

<p>
and define a prepositional phrase (e.g., "for the cat") to be a
preposition followed by a noun phrase:
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-prepositional-phrase)
  (list 'prep-phrase
	(parse-word prepositions)
	(parse-noun-phrase)))
</p>

<p>
   Now we can define a sentence to be a noun phrase followed by a verb
phrase, where a verb phrase can be either a verb or a verb phrase
extended by a prepositional phrase:(5)
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
	 (parse-noun-phrase)
	 (parse-verb-phrase)))
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend verb-phrase)
    (amb verb-phrase
	 (maybe-extend (list 'verb-phrase
			     verb-phrase
			     (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-word verbs)))
</p>

<p>
   While we're at it, we can also elaborate the definition of noun
phrases to permit such things as "a cat in the class."  What we used to
call a noun phrase, we'll now call a simple noun phrase, and a noun
phrase will now be either a simple noun phrase or a noun phrase
extended by a prepositional phrase:
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-simple-noun-phrase)
  (list 'simple-noun-phrase
	(parse-word articles)
	(parse-word nouns)))
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-noun-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend noun-phrase)
    (amb noun-phrase
	 (maybe-extend (list 'noun-phrase
			     noun-phrase
			     (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-simple-noun-phrase)))
</p>

<p>
Our new grammar lets us parse more complex sentences.  For example
</p>

<p>
(parse '(the student with the cat sleeps in the class))
</p>

<p>
produces
</p>

<p>
(sentence
 (noun-phrase
  (simple-noun-phrase (article the) (noun student))
  (prep-phrase (prep with)
	       (simple-noun-phrase
		(article the) (noun cat))))
 (verb-phrase
  (verb sleeps)
  (prep-phrase (prep in)
	       (simple-noun-phrase
		(article the) (noun class)))))
</p>

<p>
   Observe that a given input may have more than one legal parse.  In
the sentence "The professor lectures to the student with the cat," it
may be that the professor is lecturing with the cat, or that the
student has the cat.  Our nondeterministic program finds both
possibilities:
</p>

<p>
(parse '(the professor lectures to the student with the cat))
</p>

<p>
produces
</p>

<p>
(sentence
 (simple-noun-phrase (article the) (noun professor))
 (verb-phrase
  (verb-phrase
   (verb lectures)
   (prep-phrase (prep to)
		(simple-noun-phrase
		 (article the) (noun student))))
  (prep-phrase (prep with)
	       (simple-noun-phrase
		(article the) (noun cat)))))
</p>

<p>
Asking the evaluator to try again yields
</p>

<p>
(sentence
 (simple-noun-phrase (article the) (noun professor))
 (verb-phrase
  (verb lectures)
  (prep-phrase (prep to)
	       (noun-phrase
		(simple-noun-phrase
		 (article the) (noun student))
		(prep-phrase (prep with)
			     (simple-noun-phrase
			      (article the) (noun cat)))))))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.45:</b> With the grammar given above, the following
sentence can be parsed in five different ways: "The professor
lectures to the student in the class with the cat."  Give the five
parses and explain the differences in shades of meaning among them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.46:</b> The evaluators in sections *Note 4-1:: and *Note
4-2:: do not determine what order operands are evaluated in.  We
will see that the `amb' evaluator evaluates them from left to
right.  Explain why our parsing program wouldn't work if the
operands were evaluated in some other order.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.47:</b> Louis Reasoner suggests that, since a verb phrase
is either a verb or a verb phrase followed by a prepositional
phrase, it would be much more straightforward to define the
procedure `parse-verb-phrase' as follows (and similarly for noun
phrases):
</p>

<p>
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb (parse-word verbs)
       (list 'verb-phrase
	     (parse-verb-phrase)
	     (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
</p>

<p>
Does this work?  Does the program's behavior change if we
interchange the order of expressions in the `amb'
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.48:</b> Extend the grammar given above to handle more
complex sentences.  For example, you could extend noun phrases and
verb phrases to include adjectives and adverbs, or you could
handle compound sentences.(6)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.49:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in generating
interesting sentences than in parsing them.  She reasons that by
simply changing the procedure `parse-word' so that it ignores the
"input sentence" and instead always succeeds and generates an
appropriate word, we can use the programs we had built for parsing
to do generation instead.  Implement Alyssa's idea, and show the
first half-dozen or so sentences generated.(7)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Our program uses the following procedure to determine if the
elements of a list are distinct:
</p>

<p>
(define (distinct? items)
  (cond ((null? items) true)
	((null? (cdr items)) true)
	((member (car items) (cdr items)) false)
	(else (distinct? (cdr items)))))
</p>

<p>
   `Member' is like `memq' except that it uses `equal?' instead of
`eq?' to test for equality.
</p>

<p>
   (2) This is taken from a booklet called "Problematical Recreations,"
published in the 1960s by Litton Industries, where it is attributed to
the `Kansas State Engineer'.
</p>

<p>
   (3) Here we use the convention that the first element of each list
designates the part of speech for the rest of the words in the list.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Notice that `parse-word' uses `set!' to modify the unparsed
input list.  For this to work, our `amb' evaluator must undo the
effects of `set!' operations when it backtracks.
</p>

<p>
   (5) Observe that this definition is recursive&#x2013;a verb may be
followed by any number of prepositional phrases.
</p>

<p>
   (6) This kind of grammar can become arbitrarily complex, but it is
only a toy as far as real language understanding is concerned.  Real
natural-language understanding by computer requires an elaborate
mixture of syntactic analysis and interpretation of meaning.  On the
other hand, even toy parsers can be useful in supporting flexible
command languages for programs such as information-retrieval systems.
Winston 1992 discusses computational approaches to real language
understanding and also the applications of simple grammars to command
languages.
</p>

<p>
   (7) Although Alyssa's idea works just fine (and is surprisingly
simple), the sentences that it generates are a bit boring&#x2013;they don't
sample the possible sentences of this language in a very interesting
way.  In fact, the grammar is highly recursive in many places, and
Alyssa's technique "falls into" one of these recursions and gets stuck.
See *Note Exercise 4-50:: for a way to deal with this.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<hr />

<p>
The evaluation of an ordinary Scheme expression may return a value, may
never terminate, or may signal an error.  In nondeterministic Scheme
the evaluation of an expression may in addition result in the discovery
of a dead end, in which case evaluation must backtrack to a previous
choice point.  The interpretation of nondeterministic Scheme is
complicated by this extra case.
</p>

<p>
   We will construct the `amb' evaluator for nondeterministic Scheme by
modifying the analyzing evaluator of section *Note 4-1-7::.(1)  As in
the analyzing evaluator, evaluation of an expression is accomplished by
calling an execution procedure produced by analysis of that expression.
The difference between the interpretation of ordinary Scheme and the
interpretation of nondeterministic Scheme will be entirely in the
execution procedures.
</p>

<p>
Execution procedures and continuations
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Recall that the execution procedures for the ordinary evaluator take one
argument: the environment of execution.  In contrast, the execution
procedures in the `amb' evaluator take three arguments: the
environment, and two procedures called "continuation procedures".  The
evaluation of an expression will finish by calling one of these two
continuations: If the evaluation results in a value, the "success
continuation" is called with that value; if the evaluation results in
the discovery of a dead end, the "failure continuation" is called.
Constructing and calling appropriate continuations is the mechanism by
which the nondeterministic evaluator implements backtracking.
</p>

<p>
   It is the job of the success continuation to receive a value and
proceed with the computation.  Along with that value, the success
continuation is passed another failure continuation, which is to be
called subsequently if the use of that value leads to a dead end.
</p>

<p>
   It is the job of the failure continuation to try another branch of
the nondeterministic process.  The essence of the nondeterministic
language is in the fact that expressions may represent choices among
alternatives.  The evaluation of such an expression must proceed with
one of the indicated alternative choices, even though it is not known
in advance which choices will lead to acceptable results.  To deal with
this, the evaluator picks one of the alternatives and passes this value
to the success continuation.  Together with this value, the evaluator
constructs and passes along a failure continuation that can be called
later to choose a different alternative.
</p>

<p>
   A failure is triggered during evaluation (that is, a failure
continuation is called) when a user program explicitly rejects the
current line of attack (for example, a call to `require' may result in
execution of `(amb)', an expression that always fails&#x2013;see section
*Note 4-3-1::).  The failure continuation in hand at that point will
cause the most recent choice point to choose another alternative.  If
there are no more alternatives to be considered at that choice point, a
failure at an earlier choice point is triggered, and so on.  Failure
continuations are also invoked by the driver loop in response to a
`try-again' request, to find another value of the expression.
</p>

<p>
   In addition, if a side-effect operation (such as assignment to a
variable) occurs on a branch of the process resulting from a choice, it
may be necessary, when the process finds a dead end, to undo the side
effect before making a new choice.  This is accomplished by having the
side-effect operation produce a failure continuation that undoes the
side effect and propagates the failure.
</p>

<p>
In summary, failure continuations are constructed by
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>`amb' expressions&#x2013;to provide a mechanism to make alternative
choices if the current choice made by the `amb' expression leads
to a dead end;</li>

<li>the top-level driver&#x2013;to provide a mechanism to report failure
when the choices are exhausted;</li>

<li>assignments&#x2013;to intercept failures and undo assignments during
backtracking.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Failures are initiated only when a dead end is encountered.  This
occurs
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if the user program executes `(amb)';</li>

<li>if the user types `try-again' at the top-level driver.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Failure continuations are also called during processing of a failure:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When the failure continuation created by an assignment finishes
undoing a side effect, it calls the failure continuation it
intercepted, in order to propagate the failure back to the choice
point that led to this assignment or to the top level.</li>

<li>When the failure continuation for an `amb' runs out of choices, it
calls the failure continuation that was originally given to the
`amb', in order to propagate the failure back to the previous
choice point or to the top level.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Structure of the evaluator
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The syntax- and data-representation procedures for the `amb' evaluator,
and also the basic `analyze' procedure, are identical to those in the
evaluator of section *Note 4-1-7::, except for the fact that we need
additional syntax procedures to recognize the `amb' special form:(2)
</p>

<p>
(define (amb? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'amb))
</p>

<p>
(define (amb-choices exp) (cdr exp))
</p>

<p>
   We must also add to the dispatch in `analyze' a clause that will
recognize this special form and generate an appropriate execution
procedure:
</p>

<p>
((amb? exp) (analyze-amb exp))
</p>

<p>
   The top-level procedure `ambeval' (similar to the version of `eval'
given in section *Note 4-1-7::) analyzes the given expression and
applies the resulting execution procedure to the given environment,
together with two given continuations:
</p>

<p>
(define (ambeval exp env succeed fail)
  ((analyze exp) env succeed fail))
</p>

<p>
   A success continuation is a procedure of two arguments: the value
just obtained and another failure continuation to be used if that value
leads to a subsequent failure. A failure continuation is a procedure of
no arguments.  So the general form of an execution procedure is
</p>

<p>
(lambda (env succeed fail)
  ;; `succeed' is `(lambda (value fail) &#x2026;)'
  ;; `fail' is `(lambda () &#x2026;)'
  &#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
For example, executing
</p>

<p>
(ambeval &lt;EXP&gt;
	 the-global-environment
	 (lambda (value fail) value)
	 (lambda () 'failed))
</p>

<p>
will attempt to evaluate the given expression and will return either the
expression's value (if the evaluation succeeds) or the symbol `failed'
(if the evaluation fails).  The call to `ambeval' in the driver loop
shown below uses much more complicated continuation procedures, which
continue the loop and support the `try-again' request.
</p>

<p>
   Most of the complexity of the `amb' evaluator results from the
mechanics of passing the continuations around as the execution
procedures call each other.  In going through the following code, you
should compare each of the execution procedures with the corresponding
procedure for the ordinary evaluator given in section *Note 4-1-7::.
</p>

<p>
Simple expressions
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The execution procedures for the simplest kinds of expressions are
essentially the same as those for the ordinary evaluator, except for
the need to manage the continuations.  The execution procedures simply
succeed with the value of the expression, passing along the failure
continuation that was passed to them.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-self-evaluating exp)
  (lambda (env succeed fail)
    (succeed exp fail)))
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-quoted exp)
  (let ((qval (text-of-quotation exp)))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (succeed qval fail))))
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-variable exp)
  (lambda (env succeed fail)
    (succeed (lookup-variable-value exp env)
	     fail)))
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-lambda exp)
  (let ((vars (lambda-parameters exp))
	(bproc (analyze-sequence (lambda-body exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (succeed (make-procedure vars bproc env)
	       fail))))
</p>

<p>
   Notice that looking up a variable always "succeeds."  If
`lookup-variable-value' fails to find the variable, it signals an error,
as usual.  Such a "failure" indicates a program bug&#x2013;a reference to an
unbound variable; it is not an indication that we should try another
nondeterministic choice instead of the one that is currently being
tried.
</p>

<p>
Conditionals and sequences
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Conditionals are also handled in a similar way as in the ordinary
evaluator.  The execution procedure generated by `analyze-if' invokes
the predicate execution procedure `pproc' with a success continuation
that checks whether the predicate value is true and goes on to execute
either the consequent or the alternative.  If the execution of `pproc'
fails, the original failure continuation for the `if' expression is
called.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-if exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (if-predicate exp)))
	(cproc (analyze (if-consequent exp)))
	(aproc (analyze (if-alternative exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
	     ;; success continuation for evaluating the predicate
	     ;; to obtain `pred-value'
	     (lambda (pred-value fail2)
	       (if (true? pred-value)
		   (cproc env succeed fail2)
		   (aproc env succeed fail2)))
	     ;; failure continuation for evaluating the predicate
	     fail))))
</p>

<p>
   Sequences are also handled in the same way as in the previous
evaluator, except for the machinations in the subprocedure
`sequentially' that are required for passing the continuations.
Namely, to sequentially execute `a' and then `b', we call `a' with a
success continuation that calls `b'.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-sequence exps)
  (define (sequentially a b)
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (a env
	 ;; success continuation for calling `a'
	 (lambda (a-value fail2)
	   (b env succeed fail2))
	 ;; failure continuation for calling `a'
	 fail)))
  (define (loop first-proc rest-procs)
    (if (null? rest-procs)
	first-proc
	(loop (sequentially first-proc (car rest-procs))
	      (cdr rest-procs))))
  (let ((procs (map analyze exps)))
    (if (null? procs)
	(error "Empty sequence &#x2013; ANALYZE"))
    (loop (car procs) (cdr procs))))
</p>

<p>
Definitions and assignments
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Definitions are another case where we must go to some trouble to manage
the continuations, because it is necessary to evaluate the
definition-value expression before actually defining the new variable.
To accomplish this, the definition-value execution procedure `vproc' is
called with the environment, a success continuation, and the failure
continuation.  If the execution of `vproc' succeeds, obtaining a value
`val' for the defined variable, the variable is defined and the success
is propagated:
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-definition exp)
  (let ((var (definition-variable exp))
	(vproc (analyze (definition-value exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (vproc env
	     (lambda (val fail2)
	       (define-variable! var val env)
	       (succeed 'ok fail2))
	     fail))))
</p>

<p>
   Assignments are more interesting.  This is the first place where we
really use the continuations, rather than just passing them around.
The execution procedure for assignments starts out like the one for
definitions.  It first attempts to obtain the new value to be assigned
to the variable. If this evaluation of `vproc' fails, the assignment
fails.
</p>

<p>
   If `vproc' succeeds, however, and we go on to make the assignment,
we must consider the possibility that this branch of the computation
might later fail, which will require us to backtrack out of the
assignment.  Thus, we must arrange to undo the assignment as part of
the backtracking process.(3)
</p>

<p>
   This is accomplished by giving `vproc' a success continuation
(marked with the comment "<b>1</b>" below) that saves the old value of the
variable before assigning the new value to the variable and proceeding
from the assignment.  The failure continuation that is passed along
with the value of the assignment (marked with the comment "<b>2</b>" below)
restores the old value of the variable before continuing the failure.
That is, a successful assignment provides a failure continuation that
will intercept a subsequent failure; whatever failure would otherwise
have called `fail2' calls this procedure instead, to undo the
assignment before actually calling `fail2'.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-assignment exp)
  (let ((var (assignment-variable exp))
	(vproc (analyze (assignment-value exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (vproc env
	     (lambda (val fail2)        ; <b>1</b>
	       (let ((old-value
		      (lookup-variable-value var env)))
		 (set-variable-value! var val env)
		 (succeed 'ok
			  (lambda ()    ; <b>2</b>
			    (set-variable-value! var
						 old-value
						 env)
			    (fail2)))))
	     fail))))
</p>

<p>
Procedure applications
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The execution procedure for applications contains no new ideas except
for the technical complexity of managing the continuations.  This
complexity arises in `analyze-application', due to the need to keep
track of the success and failure continuations as we evaluate the
operands.  We use a procedure `get-args' to evaluate the list of
operands, rather than a simple `map' as in the ordinary evaluator.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-application exp)
  (let ((fproc (analyze (operator exp)))
	(aprocs (map analyze (operands exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (fproc env
	     (lambda (proc fail2)
	       (get-args aprocs
			 env
			 (lambda (args fail3)
			   (execute-application
			    proc args succeed fail3))
			 fail2))
	     fail))))
</p>

<p>
   In `get-args', notice how `cdr'ing down the list of `aproc'
execution procedures and `cons'ing up the resulting list of `args' is
accomplished by calling each `aproc' in the list with a success
continuation that recursively calls `get-args'.  Each of these recursive
calls to `get-args' has a success continuation whose value is the
`cons' of the newly obtained argument onto the list of accumulated
arguments:
</p>

<p>
(define (get-args aprocs env succeed fail)
  (if (null? aprocs)
      (succeed '() fail)
      ((car aprocs) env
		    ;; success continuation for this `aproc'
		    (lambda (arg fail2)
		      (get-args (cdr aprocs)
				env
				;; success continuation for recursive
				;; call to `get-args'
				(lambda (args fail3)
				  (succeed (cons arg args)
					   fail3))
				fail2))
		    fail)))
</p>

<p>
   The actual procedure application, which is performed by
`execute-application', is accomplished in the same way as for the
ordinary evaluator, except for the need to manage the continuations.
</p>

<p>
(define (execute-application proc args succeed fail)
  (cond ((primitive-procedure? proc)
	 (succeed (apply-primitive-procedure proc args)
		  fail))
	((compound-procedure? proc)
	 ((procedure-body proc)
	  (extend-environment (procedure-parameters proc)
			      args
			      (procedure-environment proc))
	  succeed
	  fail))
	(else
	 (error
	  "Unknown procedure type &#x2013; EXECUTE-APPLICATION"
	  proc))))
</p>

<p>
Evaluating `amb' expressions
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The `amb' special form is the key element in the nondeterministic
language.  Here we see the essence of the interpretation process and
the reason for keeping track of the continuations.  The execution
procedure for `amb' defines a loop `try-next' that cycles through the
execution procedures for all the possible values of the `amb'
expression.  Each execution procedure is called with a failure
continuation that will try the next one.  When there are no more
alternatives to try, the entire `amb' expression fails.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-amb exp)
  (let ((cprocs (map analyze (amb-choices exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (define (try-next choices)
	(if (null? choices)
	    (fail)
	    ((car choices) env
			   succeed
			   (lambda ()
			     (try-next (cdr choices))))))
      (try-next cprocs))))
</p>

<p>
Driver loop
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The driver loop for the `amb' evaluator is complex, due to the mechanism
that permits the user to try again in evaluating an expression.  The
driver uses a procedure called `internal-loop', which takes as argument
a procedure `try-again'.  The intent is that calling `try-again' should
go on to the next untried alternative in the nondeterministic
evaluation.  `Internal-loop' either calls `try-again' in response to
the user typing `try-again' at the driver loop, or else starts a new
evaluation by calling `ambeval'.
</p>

<p>
   The failure continuation for this call to `ambeval' informs the user
that there are no more values and re-invokes the driver loop.
</p>

<p>
   The success continuation for the call to `ambeval' is more subtle.
We print the obtained value and then invoke the internal loop again
with a `try-again' procedure that will be able to try the next
alternative.  This `next-alternative' procedure is the second argument
that was passed to the success continuation.  Ordinarily, we think of
this second argument as a failure continuation to be used if the
current evaluation branch later fails.  In this case, however, we have
completed a successful evaluation, so we can invoke the "failure"
alternative branch in order to search for additional successful
evaluations.
</p>

<p>
(define input-prompt ";;; Amb-Eval input:")
(define output-prompt ";;; Amb-Eval value:")
</p>

<p>
(define (driver-loop)
  (define (internal-loop try-again)
    (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
    (let ((input (read)))
      (if (eq? input 'try-again)
	  (try-again)
	  (begin
	    (newline)
	    (display ";;; Starting a new problem ")
	    (ambeval input
		     the-global-environment
		     ;; `ambeval' success
		     (lambda (val next-alternative)
		       (announce-output output-prompt)
		       (user-print val)
		       (internal-loop next-alternative))
		     ;; `ambeval' failure
		     (lambda ()
		       (announce-output
			";;; There are no more values of")
		       (user-print input)
		       (driver-loop)))))))
  (internal-loop
   (lambda ()
     (newline)
     (display ";;; There is no current problem")
     (driver-loop))))
</p>

<p>
   The initial call to `internal-loop' uses a `try-again' procedure that
complains that there is no current problem and restarts the driver
loop.  This is the behavior that will happen if the user types
`try-again' when there is no evaluation in progress.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.50:</b> Implement a new special form `ramb' that is like
`amb' except that it searches alternatives in a random order,
rather than from left to right.  Show how this can help with
Alyssa's problem in *Note Exercise 4-49::.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.51:</b> Implement a new kind of assignment called
`permanent-set!' that is not undone upon failure.  For example, we
can choose two distinct elements from a list and count the number
of trials required to make a successful choice as follows:
</p>

<p>
(define count 0)
</p>

<p>
(let ((x (an-element-of '(a b c)))
      (y (an-element-of '(a b c))))
  (permanent-set! count (+ count 1))
  (require (not (eq? x y)))
  (list x y count))
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(a b 2)
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
try-again
;;; Amb-Eval value:
(a c 3)
</p>

<p>
What values would have been displayed if we had used `set!' here
rather than `permanent-set!' ?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.52:</b> Implement a new construct called `if-fail' that
permits the user to catch the failure of an expression.  `If-fail'
takes two expressions.  It evaluates the first expression as usual
and returns as usual if the evaluation succeeds.  If the evaluation
fails, however, the value of the second expression is returned, as
in the following example:
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(if-fail (let ((x (an-element-of '(1 3 5))))
	   (require (even? x))
	   x)
	 'all-odd)
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
all-odd
</p>

<p>
;;; Amb-Eval input:
(if-fail (let ((x (an-element-of '(1 3 5 8))))
	   (require (even? x))
	   x)
	 'all-odd)
;;; Starting a new problem
;;; Amb-Eval value:
8
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.53:</b> With `permanent-set!' as described in *Note
Exercise 4-51:: and `if-fail' as in *Note Exercise 4-52::, what
will be the result of evaluating
</p>

<p>
(let ((pairs '()))
  (if-fail (let ((p (prime-sum-pair '(1 3 5 8) '(20 35 110))))
	     (permanent-set! pairs (cons p pairs))
	     (amb))
	   pairs))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.54:</b> If we had not realized that `require' could be
implemented as an ordinary procedure that uses `amb', to be
defined by the user as part of a nondeterministic program, we
would have had to implement it as a special form.  This would
require syntax procedures
</p>

<p>
(define (require? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'require))
</p>

<p>
(define (require-predicate exp) (cadr exp))
</p>

<p>
and a new clause in the dispatch in `analyze'
</p>

<p>
((require? exp) (analyze-require exp))
</p>

<p>
as well the procedure `analyze-require' that handles `require'
expressions.  Complete the following definition of
`analyze-require'.
</p>

<p>
(define (analyze-require exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (require-predicate exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
	     (lambda (pred-value fail2)
	       (if &lt;??&gt;
		   &lt;??&gt;
		   (succeed 'ok fail2)))
	     fail))))
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
   (1) We chose to implement the lazy evaluator in section *Note 4-2::
as a modification of the ordinary metacircular evaluator of section
*Note 4-1-1::.  In contrast, we will base the `amb' evaluator on the
analyzing evaluator of section *Note 4-1-7::, because the execution
procedures in that evaluator provide a convenient framework for
implementing backtracking.
</p>

<p>
   (2) We assume that the evaluator supports `let' (see *Note Exercise
4-22::), which we have used in our nondeterministic programs.
</p>

<p>
   (3) We didn't worry about undoing definitions, since we can assume
that internal definitions are scanned out (section *Note 4-1-6::).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
In *Note Chapter 1:: we stressed that computer science deals with
imperative (how to) knowledge, whereas mathematics deals with
declarative (what is) knowledge.  Indeed, programming languages require
that the programmer express knowledge in a form that indicates the
step-by-step methods for solving particular problems.  On the other
hand, high-level languages provide, as part of the language
implementation, a substantial amount of methodological knowledge that
frees the user from concern with numerous details of how a specified
computation will progress.
</p>

<p>
   Most programming languages, including Lisp, are organized around
computing the values of mathematical functions.  Expression-oriented
languages (such as Lisp, Fortran, and Algol) capitalize on the "pun"
that an expression that describes the value of a function may also be
interpreted as a means of computing that value.  Because of this, most
programming languages are strongly biased toward unidirectional
computations (computations with well-defined inputs and outputs).
There are, however, radically different programming languages that
relax this bias.  We saw one such example in section *Note 3-3-5::,
where the objects of computation were arithmetic constraints.  In a
constraint system the direction and the order of computation are not so
well specified; in carrying out a computation the system must therefore
provide more detailed "how to" knowledge than would be the case with an
ordinary arithmetic computation.  This does not mean, however, that the
user is released altogether from the responsibility of providing
imperative knowledge.  There are many constraint networks that
implement the same set of constraints, and the user must choose from
the set of mathematically equivalent networks a suitable network to
specify a particular computation.
</p>

<p>
   The nondeterministic program evaluator of section *Note 4-3:: also
moves away from the view that programming is about constructing
algorithms for computing unidirectional functions.  In a
nondeterministic language, expressions can have more than one value,
and, as a result, the computation is dealing with relations rather than
with single-valued functions.  Logic programming extends this idea by
combining a relational vision of programming with a powerful kind of
symbolic pattern matching called "unification".(1)
</p>

<p>
   This approach, when it works, can be a very powerful way to write
programs.  Part of the power comes from the fact that a single "what
is" fact can be used to solve a number of different problems that would
have different "how to" components.  As an example, consider the
`append' operation, which takes two lists as arguments and combines
their elements to form a single list.  In a procedural language such as
Lisp, we could define `append' in terms of the basic list constructor
`cons', as we did in section *Note 2-2-1:::
</p>

<p>
(define (append x y)
  (if (null? x)
      y
      (cons (car x) (append (cdr x) y))))
</p>

<p>
   This procedure can be regarded as a translation into Lisp of the
following two rules, the first of which covers the case where the first
list is empty and the second of which handles the case of a nonempty
list, which is a `cons' of two parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any list `y', the empty list and `y' `append' to form `y'.</li>

<li>For any `u', `v', `y', and `z', `(cons u v)' and `y' `append' to
form `(cons u z)' if `v' and `y' `append' to form `z'.(2)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Using the `append' procedure, we can answer questions such as
</p>

<p>
Find the `append' of `(a b)' and `(c d)'.
</p>

<p>
   But the same two rules are also sufficient for answering the
following sorts of questions, which the procedure can't answer:
</p>

<p>
Find a list `y' that `append's with `(a b)' to produce `(a b c d)'.
</p>

<p>
Find all `x' and `y' that `append' to form `(a b c d)'.
</p>

<p>
   In a logic programming language, the programmer writes an `append'
"procedure" by stating the two rules about `append' given above.  "How
to" knowledge is provided automatically by the interpreter to allow this
single pair of rules to be used to answer all three types of questions
about `append'.(3)
</p>

<p>
   Contemporary logic programming languages (including the one we
implement here) have substantial deficiencies, in that their general
"how to" methods can lead them into spurious infinite loops or other
undesirable behavior.  Logic programming is an active field of research
in computer science.(4)
</p>

<p>
   Earlier in this chapter we explored the technology of implementing
interpreters and described the elements that are essential to an
interpreter for a Lisp-like language (indeed, to an interpreter for any
conventional language).  Now we will apply these ideas to discuss an
interpreter for a logic programming language.  We call this language
the "query language", because it is very useful for retrieving
information from data bases by formulating "queries", or questions,
expressed in the language.  Even though the query language is very
different from Lisp, we will find it convenient to describe the
language in terms of the same general framework we have been using all
along: as a collection of primitive elements, together with means of
combination that enable us to combine simple elements to create more
complex elements and means of abstraction that enable us to regard
complex elements as single conceptual units.  An interpreter for a
logic programming language is considerably more complex than an
interpreter for a language like Lisp.  Nevertheless, we will see that
our query-language interpreter contains many of the same elements found
in the interpreter of section *Note 4-1::.  In particular, there will
be an "eval" part that classifies expressions according to type and an
"apply" part that implements the language's abstraction mechanism
(procedures in the case of Lisp, and "rules" in the case of logic
programming).  Also, a central role is played in the implementation by
a frame data structure, which determines the correspondence between
symbols and their associated values.  One additional interesting aspect
of our query-language implementation is that we make substantial use of
streams, which were introduced in *Note Chapter 3::.
</p>


<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) Logic programming has grown out of a long history of research in
automatic theorem proving.  Early theorem-proving programs could
accomplish very little, because they exhaustively searched the space of
possible proofs.  The major breakthrough that made such a search
plausible was the discovery in the early 1960s of the "unification
algorithm" and the principle "resolution principle" (Robinson 1965).
Resolution was used, for example, by Green and Raphael (1968) (see also
Green 1969) as the basis for a deductive question-answering system.
During most of this period, researchers concentrated on algorithms that
are guaranteed to find a proof if one exists.  Such algorithms were
difficult to control and to direct toward a proof.  Hewitt (1969)
recognized the possibility of merging the control structure of a
programming language with the operations of a logic-manipulation system,
leading to the work in automatic search mentioned in section *Note
4-3-1:: (footnote *Note Footnote 4-47::).  At the same time that this
was being done, Colmerauer, in Marseille, was developing rule-based
systems for manipulating natural language (see Colmerauer et al. 1973).
He invented a programming language called Prolog for representing
those rules.  Kowalski (1973; 1979), in Edinburgh, recognized that
execution of a Prolog program could be interpreted as proving theorems
(using a proof technique called linear Horn-clause resolution).  The
merging of the last two strands led to the logic-programming movement.
Thus, in assigning credit for the development of logic programming, the
French can point to Prolog's genesis at the University of Marseille,
while the British can highlight the work at the University of
Edinburgh.  According to people at MIT, logic programming was developed
by these groups in an attempt to figure out what Hewitt was talking
about in his brilliant but impenetrable Ph.D. thesis.  For a history of
logic programming, see Robinson 1983.
</p>

<p>
   (2) To see the correspondence between the rules and the procedure,
let `x' in the procedure (where `x' is nonempty) correspond to `(cons u
v)' in the rule.  Then `z' in the rule corresponds to the `append' of
`(cdr x)' and `y'.
</p>

<p>
   (3) This certainly does not relieve the user of the entire problem
of how to compute the answer.  There are many different mathematically
equivalent sets of rules for formulating the `append' relation, only
some of which can be turned into effective devices for computing in any
direction.  In addition, sometimes "what is" information gives no clue
"how to" compute an answer.  For example, consider the problem of
computing the y such that y<sup>2</sup> = x.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Interest in logic programming peaked during the early 80s when
the Japanese government began an ambitious project aimed at building
superfast computers optimized to run logic programming languages.  The
speed of such computers was to be measured in LIPS (Logical Inferences
Per Second) rather than the usual FLOPS (FLoating-point Operations Per
Second).  Although the project succeeded in developing hardware and
software as originally planned, the international computer industry
moved in a different direction.  See Feigenbaum and Shrobe 1993 for an
overview evaluation of the Japanese project.  The logic programming
community has also moved on to consider relational programming based on
techniques other than simple pattern matching, such as the ability to
deal with numerical constraints such as the ones illustrated in the
constraint-propagation system of section *Note 3-3-5::.

<p>
Logic programming excels in providing interfaces to data bases for
information retrieval.  The query language we shall implement in this
chapter is designed to be used in this way.
</p>

<p>
   In order to illustrate what the query system does, we will show how
it can be used to manage the data base of personnel records for
Microshaft, a thriving high-technology company in the Boston area.  The
language provides pattern-directed access to personnel information and
can also take advantage of general rules in order to make logical
deductions.
</p>

<p>
A sample data base
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The personnel data base for Microshaft contains "assertions" about
company personnel.  Here is the information about Ben Bitdiddle, the
resident computer wizard:
</p>

<p>
(address (Bitdiddle Ben) (Slumerville (Ridge Road) 10))
(job (Bitdiddle Ben) (computer wizard))
(salary (Bitdiddle Ben) 60000)
</p>

<p>
   Each assertion is a list (in this case a triple) whose elements can
themselves be lists.
</p>

<p>
   As resident wizard, Ben is in charge of the company's computer
division, and he supervises two programmers and one technician.  Here
is the information about them:
</p>

<p>
(address (Hacker Alyssa P) (Cambridge (Mass Ave) 78))
(job (Hacker Alyssa P) (computer programmer))
(salary (Hacker Alyssa P) 40000)
(supervisor (Hacker Alyssa P) (Bitdiddle Ben))
</p>

<p>
(address (Fect Cy D) (Cambridge (Ames Street) 3))
(job (Fect Cy D) (computer programmer))
(salary (Fect Cy D) 35000)
(supervisor (Fect Cy D) (Bitdiddle Ben))
</p>

<p>
(address (Tweakit Lem E) (Boston (Bay State Road) 22))
(job (Tweakit Lem E) (computer technician))
(salary (Tweakit Lem E) 25000)
(supervisor (Tweakit Lem E) (Bitdiddle Ben))
</p>

<p>
There is also a programmer trainee, who is supervised by Alyssa:
</p>

<p>
(address (Reasoner Louis) (Slumerville (Pine Tree Road) 80))
(job (Reasoner Louis) (computer programmer trainee))
(salary (Reasoner Louis) 30000)
(supervisor (Reasoner Louis) (Hacker Alyssa P))
</p>

<p>
   All of these people are in the computer division, as indicated by
the word `computer' as the first item in their job descriptions.
</p>

<p>
   Ben is a high-level employee.  His supervisor is the company's big
wheel himself:
</p>

<p>
(supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))
</p>

<p>
(address (Warbucks Oliver) (Swellesley (Top Heap Road)))
(job (Warbucks Oliver) (administration big wheel))
(salary (Warbucks Oliver) 150000)
</p>

<p>
   Besides the computer division supervised by Ben, the company has an
accounting division, consisting of a chief accountant and his assistant:
</p>

<p>
(address (Scrooge Eben) (Weston (Shady Lane) 10))
(job (Scrooge Eben) (accounting chief accountant))
(salary (Scrooge Eben) 75000)
(supervisor (Scrooge Eben) (Warbucks Oliver))
</p>

<p>
(address (Cratchet Robert) (Allston (N Harvard Street) 16))
(job (Cratchet Robert) (accounting scrivener))
(salary (Cratchet Robert) 18000)
(supervisor (Cratchet Robert) (Scrooge Eben))
</p>

<p>
There is also a secretary for the big wheel:
</p>

<p>
(address (Aull DeWitt) (Slumerville (Onion Square) 5))
(job (Aull DeWitt) (administration secretary))
(salary (Aull DeWitt) 25000)
(supervisor (Aull DeWitt) (Warbucks Oliver))
</p>

<p>
   The data base also contains assertions about which kinds of jobs can
be done by people holding other kinds of jobs.  For instance, a
computer wizard can do the jobs of both a computer programmer and a
computer technician:
</p>

<p>
(can-do-job (computer wizard) (computer programmer))
(can-do-job (computer wizard) (computer technician))
</p>

<p>
A computer programmer could fill in for a trainee:
</p>

<p>
(can-do-job (computer programmer)
	    (computer programmer trainee))
</p>

<p>
Also, as is well known,
</p>

<p>
(can-do-job (administration secretary)
	    (administration big wheel))
</p>

<p>
Simple queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The query language allows users to retrieve information from the data
base by posing queries in response to the system's prompt.  For
example, to find all computer programmers one can say
</p>

<p>
;;; Query input:
(job ?x (computer programmer))
</p>

<p>
The system will respond with the following items:
</p>

<p>
;;; Query results:
(job (Hacker Alyssa P) (computer programmer))
(job (Fect Cy D) (computer programmer))
</p>

<p>
   The input query specifies that we are looking for entries in the
data base that match a certain "pattern".  In this example, the pattern
specifies entries consisting of three items, of which the first is the
literal symbol `job', the second can be anything, and the third is the
literal list `(computer programmer)'.  The "anything" that can be the
second item in the matching list is specified by a "pattern variable",
`?x'.  The general form of a pattern variable is a symbol, taken to be
the name of the variable, preceded by a question mark.  We will see
below why it is useful to specify names for pattern variables rather
than just putting `?' into patterns to represent "anything."  The
system responds to a simple query by showing all entries in the data
base that match the specified pattern.
</p>

<p>
A pattern can have more than one variable.  For example, the query
</p>

<p>
(address ?x ?y)
</p>

<p>
will list all the employees' addresses.
</p>

<p>
   A pattern can have no variables, in which case the query simply
determines whether that pattern is an entry in the data base.  If so,
there will be one match; if not, there will be no matches.
</p>

<p>
   The same pattern variable can appear more than once in a query,
specifying that the same "anything" must appear in each position.  This
is why variables have names.  For example,
</p>

<p>
(supervisor ?x ?x)
</p>

<p>
finds all people who supervise themselves (though there are no such
assertions in our sample data base).
</p>

<p>
The query
</p>

<p>
(job ?x (computer ?type))
</p>

<p>
matches all job entries whose third item is a two-element list whose
first item is `computer':
</p>

<p>
(job (Bitdiddle Ben) (computer wizard))
(job (Hacker Alyssa P) (computer programmer))
(job (Fect Cy D) (computer programmer))
(job (Tweakit Lem E) (computer technician))
</p>

<p>
This same pattern does <span class="underline">not</span> match
</p>

<p>
(job (Reasoner Louis) (computer programmer trainee))
</p>

<p>
because the third item in the entry is a list of three elements, and the
pattern's third item specifies that there should be two elements.  If
we wanted to change the pattern so that the third item could be any
list beginning with `computer', we could specify(1)
</p>

<p>
(job ?x (computer . ?type))
</p>

<p>
For example,
</p>

<p>
(computer . ?type)
</p>

<p>
matches the data
</p>

<p>
(computer programmer trainee)
</p>

<p>
with `?type' as the list `(programmer trainee)'.  It also matches the
data
</p>

<p>
(computer programmer)
</p>

<p>
with `?type' as the list `(programmer)', and matches the data
</p>

<p>
(computer)
</p>

<p>
with `?type' as the empty list `()'.
</p>

<p>
   We can describe the query language's processing of simple queries as
follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The system finds all assignments to variables in the query pattern
that "satisfy" the pattern&#x2013;that is, all sets of values for the
variables such that if the pattern variables are "instantiated
with" (replaced by) the values, the result is in the data base.</li>

<li>The system responds to the query by listing all instantiations of
the query pattern with the variable assignments that satisfy it.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Note that if the pattern has no variables, the query reduces to a
determination of whether that pattern is in the data base.  If so, the
empty assignment, which assigns no values to variables, satisfies that
pattern for that data base.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.55:</b> Give simple queries that retrieve the following
information from the data base:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle;</li>

<li>the names and jobs of all people in the accounting division;</li>

<li>the names and addresses of all people who live in Slumerville.</li>
</ol>


<p>
Compound queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Simple queries form the primitive operations of the query language.  In
order to form compound operations, the query language provides means of
combination.  One thing that makes the query language a logic
programming language is that the means of combination mirror the means
of combination used in forming logical expressions: `and', `or', and
`not'.  (Here `and', `or', and `not' are not the Lisp primitives, but
rather operations built into the query language.)
</p>

<p>
   We can use `and' as follows to find the addresses of all the computer
programmers:
</p>

<p>
(and (job ?person (computer programmer))
     (address ?person ?where))
</p>

<p>
The resulting output is
</p>

<p>
(and (job (Hacker Alyssa P) (computer programmer))
     (address (Hacker Alyssa P) (Cambridge (Mass Ave) 78)))
</p>

<p>
(and (job (Fect Cy D) (computer programmer))
     (address (Fect Cy D) (Cambridge (Ames Street) 3)))
</p>

<p>
In general,
</p>

<p>
(and &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;QUERY<sub>2</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;QUERY<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
is satisfied by all sets of values for the pattern variables that
simultaneously satisfy &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;QUERY<sub>N</sub>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
   As for simple queries, the system processes a compound query by
finding all assignments to the pattern variables that satisfy the
query, then displaying instantiations of the query with those values.
</p>

<p>
   Another means of constructing compound queries is through `or'.  For
example,
</p>

<p>
(or (supervisor ?x (Bitdiddle Ben))
    (supervisor ?x (Hacker Alyssa P)))
</p>

<p>
will find all employees supervised by Ben Bitdiddle or Alyssa P.

<p>
(or &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt; &lt;QUERY<sub>2</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;QUERY<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
is satisfied by all sets of values for the pattern variables that
satisfy at least one of &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;QUERY<sub>N</sub>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Compound queries can also be formed with `not'. For example,
</p>

<p>
(and (supervisor ?x (Bitdiddle Ben))
     (not (job ?x (computer programmer))))
</p>

<p>
finds all people supervised by Ben Bitdiddle who are not computer
programmers.  In general,
</p>

<p>
(not &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
is satisfied by all assignments to the pattern variables that do not
satisfy &lt;QUERY<sub>1</sub>&gt;.(2)
</p>

<p>
   The final combining form is called `lisp-value'.  When `lisp-value'
is the first element of a pattern, it specifies that the next element
is a Lisp predicate to be applied to the rest of the (instantiated)
elements as arguments.  In general,
</p>

<p>
(lisp-value &lt;PREDICATE&gt; &lt;ARG<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026; &lt;ARG<sub>N</sub>&gt;)
</p>

<p>
will be satisfied by assignments to the pattern variables for which the
&lt;PREDICATE&gt; applied to the instantiated &lt;ARG<sub>1</sub>&gt; &#x2026;  &lt;ARG<sub>N</sub>&gt; is true.
For example, to find all people whose salary is greater than $30,000 we
could write(3)
</p>

<p>
(and (salary ?person ?amount)
     (lisp-value &gt; ?amount 30000))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.56:</b> Formulate compound queries that retrieve the
following information:
</p>

<p>
a. the names of all people who are supervised by Ben Bitdiddle,
   together with their addresses;
</p>

<p>
b. all people whose salary is less than Ben Bitdiddle's,
   together with their salary and Ben Bitdiddle's salary;
</p>

<p>
c. all people who are supervised by someone who is not in the
   computer division, together with the supervisor's name and
   job.
</p>


<p>
Rules
&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
In addition to primitive queries and compound queries, the query
language provides means for abstracting queries.  These are given by "rules".
The rule
</p>

<p>
(rule (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
      (and (address ?person-1 (?town . ?rest-1))
	   (address ?person-2 (?town . ?rest-2))
	   (not (same ?person-1 ?person-2))))
</p>

<p>
specifies that two people live near each other if they live in the same
town.  The final `not' clause prevents the rule from saying that all
people live near themselves.  The `same' relation is defined by a very
simple rule:(4)
</p>

<p>
(rule (same ?x ?x))
</p>

<p>
   The following rule declares that a person is a "wheel" in an
organization if he supervises someone who is in turn a supervisor:
</p>

<p>
(rule (wheel ?person)
      (and (supervisor ?middle-manager ?person)
	   (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))
</p>

<p>
The general form of a rule is
</p>

<p>
(rule &lt;CONCLUSION&gt; &lt;BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
where &lt;CONCLUSION&gt; is a pattern and &lt;BODY&gt; is any query.(5) We can
think of a rule as representing a large (even infinite) set of
assertions, namely all instantiations of the rule conclusion with
variable assignments that satisfy the rule body.  When we described
simple queries (patterns), we said that an assignment to variables
satisfies a pattern if the instantiated pattern is in the data base.
But the pattern needn't be explicitly in the data base as an assertion.
It can be an implicit assertion implied by a rule.  For example, the
query
</p>

<p>
(lives-near ?x (Bitdiddle Ben))
</p>

<p>
results in
</p>

<p>
(lives-near (Reasoner Louis) (Bitdiddle Ben))
(lives-near (Aull DeWitt) (Bitdiddle Ben))
</p>

<p>
   To find all computer programmers who live near Ben Bitdiddle, we can
ask
</p>

<p>
(and (job ?x (computer programmer))
     (lives-near ?x (Bitdiddle Ben)))
</p>

<p>
   As in the case of compound procedures, rules can be used as parts of
other rules (as we saw with the `lives-near' rule above) or even be
defined recursively.  For instance, the rule
</p>

<p>
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
	  (and (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager)
	       (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss))))
</p>

<p>
says that a staff person is outranked by a boss in the organization if
the boss is the person's supervisor or (recursively) if the person's
supervisor is outranked by the boss.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.57:</b> Define a rule that says that person 1 can replace
person 2 if either person 1 does the same job as person 2 or
someone who does person 1's job can also do person 2's job, and if
person 1 and person 2 are not the same person. Using your rule,
give queries that find the following:
</p>

<p>
a. all people who can replace Cy D. Fect;
</p>

<p>
b. all people who can replace someone who is being paid more
   than they are, together with the two salaries.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.58:</b> Define a rule that says that a person is a "big
shot" in a division if the person works in the division but does
not have a supervisor who works in the division.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.59:</b> Ben Bitdiddle has missed one meeting too many.
Fearing that his habit of forgetting meetings could cost him his
job, Ben decides to do something about it.  He adds all the weekly
meetings of the firm to the Microshaft data base by asserting the
following:
</p>

<p>
(meeting accounting (Monday 9am))
(meeting administration (Monday 10am))
(meeting computer (Wednesday 3pm))
(meeting administration (Friday 1pm))
</p>

<p>
Each of the above assertions is for a meeting of an entire
division.  Ben also adds an entry for the company-wide meeting
that spans all the divisions.  All of the company's employees
attend this meeting.
</p>

<p>
(meeting whole-company (Wednesday 4pm))
</p>

<p>
a. On Friday morning, Ben wants to query the data base for all
   the meetings that occur that day.  What query should he use?
</p>

<p>
b. Alyssa P. Hacker is unimpressed.  She thinks it would be much
   more useful to be able to ask for her meetings by specifying
   her name.  So she designs a rule that says that a person's
   meetings include all `whole-company' meetings plus all
   meetings of that person's division.  Fill in the body of
   Alyssa's rule.
</p>

<p>
(rule (meeting-time ?person ?day-and-time)
      &lt;RULE-BODY&gt;)
</p>

<p>
c. Alyssa arrives at work on Wednesday morning and wonders what
   meetings she has to attend that day.  Having defined the
   above rule, what query should she make to find this out?
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.60:</b> By giving the query
</p>

<p>
(lives-near ?person (Hacker Alyssa P))
</p>

<p>
Alyssa P. Hacker is able to find people who live near her, with
whom she can ride to work.  On the other hand, when she tries to
find all pairs of people who live near each other by querying
</p>

<p>
(lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
</p>

<p>
she notices that each pair of people who live near each other is
listed twice; for example,
</p>

<p>
(lives-near (Hacker Alyssa P) (Fect Cy D))
(lives-near (Fect Cy D) (Hacker Alyssa P))
</p>

<p>
Why does this happen?  Is there a way to find a list of people who
live near each other, in which each pair appears only once?
Explain.
</p>

<p>
Logic as programs
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
We can regard a rule as a kind of logical implication: <span class="underline">If</span> an
assignment of values to pattern variables satisfies the body, <span class="underline">then</span> it
satisfies the conclusion.  Consequently, we can regard the query
language as having the ability to perform "logical deductions" based
upon the rules.  As an example, consider the `append' operation
described at the beginning of section *Note 4-4::.  As we said,
`append' can be characterized by the following two rules:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For any list `y', the empty list and `y' `append' to form `y'.</li>

<li>For any `u', `v', `y', and `z', `(cons u v)' and `y' `append' to
form `(cons u z)' if `v' and `y' `append' to form `z'.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   To express this in our query language, we define two rules for a
relation
</p>

<p>
(append-to-form x y z)
</p>

<p>
which we can interpret to mean "`x' and `y' `append' to form `z'":
</p>

<p>
(rule (append-to-form () ?y ?y))
</p>

<p>
(rule (append-to-form (?u . ?v) ?y (?u . ?z))
      (append-to-form ?v ?y ?z))
</p>

<p>
   The first rule has no body, which means that the conclusion holds
for any value of `?y'.  Note how the second rule makes use of
dotted-tail notation to name the `car' and `cdr' of a list.
</p>

<p>
   Given these two rules, we can formulate queries that compute the
`append' of two lists:
</p>

<p>
;;; Query input:
(append-to-form (a b) (c d) ?z)
;;; Query results:
(append-to-form (a b) (c d) (a b c d))
</p>

<p>
   What is more striking, we can use the same rules to ask the question
"Which list, when `append'ed to `(a b)', yields `(a b c d)'?"  This is
done as follows:
</p>

<p>
;;; Query input:
(append-to-form (a b) ?y (a b c d))
;;; Query results:
(append-to-form (a b) (c d) (a b c d))
</p>

<p>
   We can also ask for all pairs of lists that `append' to form `(a b c
d)':
</p>

<p>
;;; Query input:
(append-to-form ?x ?y (a b c d))
;;; Query results:
(append-to-form () (a b c d) (a b c d))
(append-to-form (a) (b c d) (a b c d))
(append-to-form (a b) (c d) (a b c d))
(append-to-form (a b c) (d) (a b c d))
(append-to-form (a b c d) () (a b c d))
</p>

<p>
   The query system may seem to exhibit quite a bit of intelligence in
using the rules to deduce the answers to the queries above.  Actually,
as we will see in the next section, the system is following a
well-determined algorithm in unraveling the rules.  Unfortunately,
although the system works impressively in the `append' case, the
general methods may break down in more complex cases, as we will see in
section *Note 4-4-3::.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.61:</b> The following rules implement a `next-to'
relation that finds adjacent elements of a list:
</p>

<p>
(rule (?x next-to ?y in (?x ?y . ?u)))
</p>

<p>
(rule (?x next-to ?y in (?v . ?z))
      (?x next-to ?y in ?z))
</p>

<p>
What will the response be to the following queries?
</p>

<p>
(?x next-to ?y in (1 (2 3) 4))
</p>

<p>
(?x next-to 1 in (2 1 3 1))
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.62:</b> Define rules to implement the `last-pair'
operation of *Note Exercise 2-17::, which returns a list
containing the last element of a nonempty list.  Check your rules
on queries such as `(last-pair (3) ?x)', `(last-pair (1 2 3) ?x)',
and `(last-pair (2 ?x) (3))'.  Do your rules work correctly on
queries such as `(last-pair ?x (3))' ?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.63:</b> The following data base (see Genesis 4) traces
the genealogy of the descendants of Ada back to Adam, by way of
Cain:
</p>

<p>
(son Adam Cain)
(son Cain Enoch)
(son Enoch Irad)
(son Irad Mehujael)
(son Mehujael Methushael)
(son Methushael Lamech)
(wife Lamech Ada)
(son Ada Jabal)
(son Ada Jubal)
</p>

<p>
Formulate rules such as "If S is the son of f, and f is the son of
G, then S is the grandson of G" and "If W is the wife of M, and S
is the son of W, then S is the son of M" (which was supposedly
more true in biblical times than today) that will enable the query
system to find the grandson of Cain; the sons of Lamech; the
grandsons of Methushael.  (See *Note Exercise 4-69:: for some
rules to deduce more complicated relationships.)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
   (1) This uses the dotted-tail notation introduced in *Note Exercise
2-20::.
</p>

<p>
   (2) Actually, this description of `not' is valid only for simple
cases.  The real behavior of `not' is more complex.  We will examine
`not''s peculiarities in sections *Note 4-4-2:: and *Note 4-4-3::.
</p>

<p>
   (3) `Lisp-value' should be used only to perform an operation not
provided in the query language.  In particular, it should not be used
to test equality (since that is what the matching in the query language
is designed to do) or inequality (since that can be done with the
`same' rule shown below).
</p>

<p>
   (4) Notice that we do not need `same' in order to make two things be
the same: We just use the same pattern variable for each&#x2013;in effect, we
have one thing instead of two things in the first place.  For example,
see `?town' in the `lives-near' rule and `?middle-manager' in the
`wheel' rule below.  `Same' is useful when we want to force two things
to be different, such as `?person-1' and `?person-2' in the
`lives-near' rule.  Although using the same pattern variable in two
parts of a query forces the same value to appear in both places, using
different pattern variables does not force different values to appear.
(The values assigned to different pattern variables may be the same or
different.)
</p>

<p>
   (5) We will also allow rules without bodies, as in `same', and we
will interpret such a rule to mean that the rule conclusion is
satisfied by any values of the variables.

<h3 id="orgfc7b9f2"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> How the Query System Works</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<hr />

<p>
In section *Note 4-4-4:: we will present an implementation of the query
interpreter as a collection of procedures.  In this section we give an
overview that explains the general structure of the system independent
of low-level implementation details.  After describing the
implementation of the interpreter, we will be in a position to
understand some of its limitations and some of the subtle ways in which
the query language's logical operations differ from the operations of
mathematical logic.
</p>

<p>
   It should be apparent that the query evaluator must perform some
kind of search in order to match queries against facts and rules in the
data base.  One way to do this would be to implement the query system
as a nondeterministic program, using the `amb' evaluator of section
*Note 4-3:: (see *Note Exercise 4-78::).  Another possibility is to
manage the search with the aid of streams.  Our implementation follows
this second approach.
</p>

<p>
   The query system is organized around two central operations called "pattern
matching" and "unification".  We first describe pattern matching and
explain how this operation, together with the organization of
information in terms of streams of frames, enables us to implement both
simple and compound queries.  We next discuss unification, a
generalization of pattern matching needed to implement rules.  Finally,
we show how the entire query interpreter fits together through a
procedure that classifies expressions in a manner analogous to the way
`eval' classifies expressions for the interpreter described in section
*Note 4-1::.
</p>

<p>
Pattern matching
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
A "pattern matcher" is a program that tests whether some datum fits a
specified pattern.  For example, the data list `((a b) c (a b))' matches
the pattern `(?x c ?x)' with the pattern variable `?x' bound to `(a
b)'.  The same data list matches the pattern `(?x ?y ?z)' with `?x' and
`?z' both bound to `(a b)' and `?y' bound to `c'.  It also matches the
pattern `((?x ?y) c (?x ?y))' with `?x' bound to `a' and `?y' bound to
`b'.  However, it does not match the pattern `(?x a ?y)', since that
pattern specifies a list whose second element is the symbol `a'.
</p>

<p>
   The pattern matcher used by the query system takes as inputs a
pattern, a datum, and a "frame" that specifies bindings for various
pattern variables.  It checks whether the datum matches the pattern in
a way that is consistent with the bindings already in the frame.  If
so, it returns the given frame augmented by any bindings that may have
been determined by the match.  Otherwise, it indicates that the match
has failed.
</p>

<p>
   For example, using the pattern `(?x ?y ?x)' to match `(a b a)' given
an empty frame will return a frame specifying that `?x' is bound to `a'
and `?y' is bound to `b'.  Trying the match with the same pattern, the
same datum, and a frame specifying that `?y' is bound to `a' will fail.
Trying the match with the same pattern, the same datum, and a frame in
which `?y' is bound to `b' and `?x' is unbound will return the given
frame augmented by a binding of `?x' to `a'.
</p>

<p>
   The pattern matcher is all the mechanism that is needed to process
simple queries that don't involve rules.  For instance, to process the
query
</p>

<p>
(job ?x (computer programmer))
</p>

<p>
we scan through all assertions in the data base and select those that
match the pattern with respect to an initially empty frame.  For each
match we find, we use the frame returned by the match to instantiate
the pattern with a value for `?x'.
</p>

<p>
Streams of frames
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The testing of patterns against frames is organized through the use of
streams.  Given a single frame, the matching process runs through the
data-base entries one by one.  For each data-base entry, the matcher
generates either a special symbol indicating that the match has failed
or an extension to the frame.  The results for all the data-base
entries are collected into a stream, which is passed through a filter
to weed out the failures.  The result is a stream of all the frames
that extend the given frame via a match to some assertion in the data
base.(1)
</p>

<p>
   In our system, a query takes an input stream of frames and performs
the above matching operation for every frame in the stream, as
indicated in *Note Figure 4-4::.  That is, for each frame in the input
stream, the query generates a new stream consisting of all extensions
to that frame by matches to assertions in the data base.  All these
streams are then combined to form one huge stream, which contains all
possible extensions of every frame in the input stream.  This stream is
the output of the query.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 4.4:</b> A query processes a stream of frames.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc9bdd1a">
                                  output stream
  input stream   +-------------+  of frames,
  of frames      |    query    |  filtered and extended
----------------&gt;|             +-------------------------&gt;
                 | (job ?x ?y) |

               stream of assertions
                  from data base
</pre>

<p>
   To answer a simple query, we use the query with an input stream
consisting of a single empty frame.  The resulting output stream
contains all extensions to the empty frame (that is, all answers to our
query).  This stream of frames is then used to generate a stream of
copies of the original query pattern with the variables instantiated by
the values in each frame, and this is the stream that is finally
printed.
</p>

<p>
Compound queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The real elegance of the stream-of-frames implementation is evident
when we deal with compound queries.  The processing of compound queries
makes use of the ability of our matcher to demand that a match be
consistent with a specified frame.  For example, to handle the `and' of
two queries, such as
</p>

<p>
(and (can-do-job ?x (computer programmer trainee))
     (job ?person ?x))
</p>

<p>
(informally, "Find all people who can do the job of a computer
programmer trainee"), we first find all entries that match the pattern
</p>

<p>
(can-do-job ?x (computer programmer trainee))
</p>

<p>
   This produces a stream of frames, each of which contains a binding
for `?x'.  Then for each frame in the stream we find all entries that
match
</p>

<p>
(job ?person ?x)
</p>

<p>
in a way that is consistent with the given binding for `?x'.  Each such
match will produce a frame containing bindings for `?x' and `?person'.
The `and' of two queries can be viewed as a series combination of the
two component queries, as shown in *Note Figure 4-5::.  The frames that
pass through the first query filter are filtered and further extended
by the second query.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 4.5:</b> The `and' combination of two queries is produced by
operating on the stream of frames in series.

<p>
   Even from this high-level description, it is apparent that the
processing of compound queries can be slow.  For example, since a query
may produce more than one output frame for each input frame, and each
query in an `and' gets its input frames from the previous query, an
`and' query could, in the worst case, have to perform a number of
matches that is exponential in the number of queries (see *Note
Exercise 4-76::).(2) Though systems for handling only simple queries
are quite practical, dealing with complex queries is extremely
difficult.(3)
</p>

<p>
   From the stream-of-frames viewpoint, the `not' of some query acts as
a filter that removes all frames for which the query can be satisfied.
For instance, given the pattern
</p>

<p>
(not (job ?x (computer programmer)))
</p>

<p>
we attempt, for each frame in the input stream, to produce extension
frames that satisfy `(job ?x (computer programmer))'.  We remove from
the input stream all frames for which such extensions exist.  The
result is a stream consisting of only those frames in which the binding
for `?x' does not satisfy `(job ?x (computer programmer))'.  For
example, in processing the query
</p>

<p>
(and (supervisor ?x ?y)
     (not (job ?x (computer programmer))))
</p>

<p>
the first clause will generate frames with bindings for `?x' and `?y'.
The `not' clause will then filter these by removing all frames in which
the binding for `?x' satisfies the restriction that `?x' is a computer
programmer.(4)
</p>

<p>
   The `lisp-value' special form is implemented as a similar filter on
frame streams.  We use each frame in the stream to instantiate any
variables in the pattern, then apply the Lisp predicate.  We remove
from the input stream all frames for which the predicate fails.
</p>

<p>
Unification
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
In order to handle rules in the query language, we must be able to find
the rules whose conclusions match a given query pattern.  Rule
conclusions are like assertions except that they can contain variables,
so we will need a generalization of pattern matching&#x2013;called "unification"&#x2013;in
which both the "pattern" and the "datum" may contain variables.
</p>

<p>
   A unifier takes two patterns, each containing constants and
variables, and determines whether it is possible to assign values to
the variables that will make the two patterns equal.  If so, it returns
a frame containing these bindings.  For example, unifying `(?x a ?y)'
and `(?y ?z a)' will specify a frame in which `?x', `?y', and `?z' must
all be bound to `a'.  On the other hand, unifying `(?x ?y a)' and `(?x
b ?y)' will fail, because there is no value for `?y' that can make the
two patterns equal.  (For the second elements of the patterns to be
equal, `?y' would have to be `b'; however, for the third elements to be
equal, `?y' would have to be `a'.)  The unifier used in the query
system, like the pattern matcher, takes a frame as input and performs
unifications that are consistent with this frame.
</p>

<p>
   The unification algorithm is the most technically difficult part of
the query system.  With complex patterns, performing unification may
seem to require deduction.  To unify `(?x ?x)' and `((a ?y c) (a b
?z))', for example, the algorithm must infer that `?x' should be `(a b
c)', `?y' should be `b', and `?z' should be `c'.  We may think of this
process as solving a set of equations among the pattern components.  In
general, these are simultaneous equations, which may require substantial
manipulation to solve.(5) For example, unifying `(?x ?x)' and `((a ?y
c) (a b ?z))' may be thought of as specifying the simultaneous equations
</p>

<p>
?x  =  (a ?y c)
?x  =  (a b ?z)
</p>

<p>
These equations imply that
</p>

<p>
(a ?y c)  =  (a b ?z)
</p>

<p>
which in turn implies that
</p>

<p>
a  =  a, ?y  =  b, c  =  ?z,
</p>

<p>
and hence that
</p>

<p>
?x  =  (a b c)
</p>

<p>
   In a successful pattern match, all pattern variables become bound,
and the values to which they are bound contain only constants.  This is
also true of all the examples of unification we have seen so far.  In
general, however, a successful unification may not completely determine
the variable values; some variables may remain unbound and others may
be bound to values that contain variables.
</p>

<p>
   Consider the unification of `(?x a)' and `((b ?y) ?z)'.  We can
deduce that `?x = (b ?y)' and `a = ?z', but we cannot further solve for
`?x' or `?y'.  The unification doesn't fail, since it is certainly
possible to make the two patterns equal by assigning values to `?x' and
`?y'.  Since this match in no way restricts the values `?y' can take
on, no binding for `?y' is put into the result frame.  The match does,
however, restrict the value of `?x'.  Whatever value `?y' has, `?x'
must be `(b ?y)'.  A binding of `?x' to the pattern `(b ?y)' is thus
put into the frame.  If a value for `?y' is later determined and added
to the frame (by a pattern match or unification that is required to be
consistent with this frame), the previously bound `?x' will refer to
this value.(6)
</p>

<p>
Applying rules
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
Unification is the key to the component of the query system that makes
inferences from rules. To see how this is accomplished, consider
processing a query that involves applying a rule, such as
</p>

<p>
(lives-near ?x (Hacker Alyssa P))
</p>

<p>
   To process this query, we first use the ordinary pattern-match
procedure described above to see if there are any assertions in the
data base that match this pattern.  (There will not be any in this
case, since our data base includes no direct assertions about who lives
near whom.)  The next step is to attempt to unify the query pattern
with the conclusion of each rule.  We find that the pattern unifies
with the conclusion of the rule
</p>

<p>
(rule (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
      (and (address ?person-1 (?town . ?rest-1))
	   (address ?person-2 (?town . ?rest-2))
	   (not (same ?person-1 ?person-2))))
</p>

<p>
resulting in a frame specifying that `?person-2' is bound to `(Hacker
Alyssa P)' and that `?x' should be bound to (have the same value as)
`?person-1'.  Now, relative to this frame, we evaluate the compound
query given by the body of the rule.  Successful matches will extend
this frame by providing a binding for `?person-1', and consequently a
value for `?x', which we can use to instantiate the original query
pattern.
</p>

<p>
   In general, the query evaluator uses the following method to apply a
rule when trying to establish a query pattern in a frame that specifies
bindings for some of the pattern variables:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unify the query with the conclusion of the rule to form, if
successful, an extension of the original frame.</li>

<li>Relative to the extended frame, evaluate the query formed by the
body of the rule.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Notice how similar this is to the method for applying a procedure in
the `eval'/`apply' evaluator for Lisp:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bind the procedure's parameters to its arguments to form a frame
that extends the original procedure environment.</li>

<li>Relative to the extended environment, evaluate the expression
formed by the body of the procedure.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   The similarity between the two evaluators should come as no
surprise.  Just as procedure definitions are the means of abstraction
in Lisp, rule definitions are the means of abstraction in the query
language.  In each case, we unwind the abstraction by creating
appropriate bindings and evaluating the rule or procedure body relative
to these.
</p>

<p>
Simple queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
We saw earlier in this section how to evaluate simple queries in the
absence of rules.  Now that we have seen how to apply rules, we can
describe how to evaluate simple queries by using both rules and
assertions.
</p>

<p>
   Given the query pattern and a stream of frames, we produce, for each
frame in the input stream, two streams:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a stream of extended frames obtained by matching the pattern
against all assertions in the data base (using the pattern
matcher), and</li>

<li>a stream of extended frames obtained by applying all possible
rules (using the unifier).(7)</li>
</ul>


<p>
   Appending these two streams produces a stream that consists of all
the ways that the given pattern can be satisfied consistent with the
original frame.  These streams (one for each frame in the input stream)
are now all combined to form one large stream, which therefore consists
of all the ways that any of the frames in the original input stream can
be extended to produce a match with the given pattern.
</p>

<p>
The query evaluator and the driver loop
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Despite the complexity of the underlying matching operations, the
system is organized much like an evaluator for any language.  The
procedure that coordinates the matching operations is called `qeval',
and it plays a role analogous to that of the `eval' procedure for Lisp.
`Qeval' takes as inputs a query and a stream of frames.  Its output is
a stream of frames, corresponding to successful matches to the query
pattern, that extend some frame in the input stream, as indicated in
*Note Figure 4-4::.  Like `eval', `qeval' classifies the different
types of expressions (queries) and dispatches to an appropriate
procedure for each.  There is a procedure for each special form (`and',
`or', `not', and `lisp-value') and one for simple queries.
</p>

<p>
   The driver loop, which is analogous to the `driver-loop' procedure
for the other evaluators in this chapter, reads queries from the
terminal.  For each query, it calls `qeval' with the query and a stream
that consists of a single empty frame.  This will produce the stream of
all possible matches (all possible extensions to the empty frame).  For
each frame in the resulting stream, it instantiates the original query
using the values of the variables found in the frame.  This stream of
instantiated queries is then printed.(8)
</p>

<p>
   The driver also checks for the special command `assert!', which
signals that the input is not a query but rather an assertion or rule
to be added to the data base.  For instance,
</p>

<p>
(assert! (job (Bitdiddle Ben) (computer wizard)))
</p>

<p>
(assert! (rule (wheel ?person)
	       (and (supervisor ?middle-manager ?person)
		    (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager))))
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
   (1) Because matching is generally very expensive, we would like to
avoid applying the full matcher to every element of the data base.
This is usually arranged by breaking up the process into a fast, coarse
match and the final match.  The coarse match filters the data base to
produce a small set of candidates for the final match.  With care, we
can arrange our data base so that some of the work of coarse matching
can be done when the data base is constructed rather then when we want
to select the candidates.  This is called "indexing" the data base.
There is a vast technology built around data-base-indexing schemes.
Our implementation, described in section *Note 4-4-4::, contains a
simple-minded form of such an optimization.
</p>

<p>
   (2) But this kind of exponential explosion is not common in `and'
queries because the added conditions tend to reduce rather than expand
the number of frames produced.
</p>

<p>
   (3) There is a large literature on data-base-management systems that
is concerned with how to handle complex queries efficiently.
</p>

<p>
   (4) There is a subtle difference between this filter implementation
of `not' and the usual meaning of `not' in mathematical logic.  See
section *Note 4-4-3::.
</p>

<p>
   (5) In one-sided pattern matching, all the equations that contain
pattern variables are explicit and already solved for the unknown (the
pattern variable).
</p>

<p>
   (6) Another way to think of unification is that it generates the
most general pattern that is a specialization of the two input
patterns.  That is, the unification of `(?x a)' and `((b ?y) ?z)' is
`((b ?y) a)', and the unification of `(?x a ?y)' and `(?y ?z a)',
discussed above, is `(a a a)'.  For our implementation, it is more
convenient to think of the result of unification as a frame rather than
a pattern.
</p>

<p>
   (7) Since unification is a generalization of matching, we could
simplify the system by using the unifier to produce both streams.
Treating the easy case with the simple matcher, however, illustrates
how matching (as opposed to full-blown unification) can be useful in
its own right.
</p>

<p>
   (8) The reason we use streams (rather than lists) of frames is that
the recursive application of rules can generate infinite numbers of
values that satisfy a query.  The delayed evaluation embodied in
streams is crucial here: The system will print responses one by one as
they are generated, regardless of whether there are a finite or
infinite number of responses.

<p>
The means of combination used in the query language may at first seem
identical to the operations `and', `or', and `not' of mathematical
logic, and the application of query-language rules is in fact
accomplished through a legitimate method of inference.(1) This
identification of the query language with mathematical logic is not
really valid, though, because the query language provides a structure
"control structure" that interprets the logical statements
procedurally.  We can often take advantage of this control structure.
For example, to find all of the supervisors of programmers we could
formulate a query in either of two logically equivalent forms:
</p>

<p>
(and (job ?x (computer programmer))
     (supervisor ?x ?y))
</p>

<p>
or
</p>

<p>
(and (supervisor ?x ?y)
     (job ?x (computer programmer)))
</p>

<p>
   If a company has many more supervisors than programmers (the usual
case), it is better to use the first form rather than the second
because the data base must be scanned for each intermediate result
(frame) produced by the first clause of the `and'.
</p>

<p>
   The aim of logic programming is to provide the programmer with
techniques for decomposing a computational problem into two separate
problems: "what" is to be computed, and "how" this should be computed.
This is accomplished by selecting a subset of the statements of
mathematical logic that is powerful enough to be able to describe
anything one might want to compute, yet weak enough to have a
controllable procedural interpretation.  The intention here is that, on
the one hand, a program specified in a logic programming language
should be an effective program that can be carried out by a computer.
Control ("how" to compute) is effected by using the order of evaluation
of the language.  We should be able to arrange the order of clauses and
the order of subgoals within each clause so that the computation is
done in an order deemed to be effective and efficient.  At the same
time, we should be able to view the result of the computation ("what"
to compute) as a simple consequence of the laws of logic.
</p>

<p>
   Our query language can be regarded as just such a procedurally
interpretable subset of mathematical logic.  An assertion represents a
simple fact (an atomic proposition).  A rule represents the implication
that the rule conclusion holds for those cases where the rule body
holds.  A rule has a natural procedural interpretation: To establish
the conclusion of the rule, establish the body of the rule.  Rules,
therefore, specify computations.  However, because rules can also be
regarded as statements of mathematical logic, we can justify any
"inference" accomplished by a logic program by asserting that the same
result could be obtained by working entirely within mathematical
logic.(2)
</p>

<p>
Infinite loops
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
A consequence of the procedural interpretation of logic programs is
that it is possible to construct hopelessly inefficient programs for
solving certain problems.  An extreme case of inefficiency occurs when
the system falls into infinite loops in making deductions.  As a simple
example, suppose we are setting up a data base of famous marriages,
including
</p>

<p>
(assert! (married Minnie Mickey))
</p>

<p>
If we now ask
</p>

<p>
(married Mickey ?who)
</p>

<p>
we will get no response, because the system doesn't know that if A is
married to B, then B is married to A.  So we assert the rule
</p>

<p>
(assert! (rule (married ?x ?y)
	       (married ?y ?x)))
</p>

<p>
and again query
</p>

<p>
(married Mickey ?who)
</p>

<p>
   Unfortunately, this will drive the system into an infinite loop, as
follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The system finds that the `married' rule is applicable; that is,
the rule conclusion `(married ?x ?y)' successfully unifies with
the query pattern `(married Mickey ?who)' to produce a frame in
which `?x' is bound to `Mickey' and `?y' is bound to `?who'.  So
the interpreter proceeds to evaluate the rule body `(married ?y
?x)' in this frame&#x2013;in effect, to process the query `(married ?who
Mickey)'.</li>

<li>One answer appears directly as an assertion in the data base:
`(married Minnie Mickey)'.</li>

<li>The `married' rule is also applicable, so the interpreter again
evaluates the rule body, which this time is equivalent to
`(married Mickey ?who)'.</li>
</ul>


<p>
   The system is now in an infinite loop.  Indeed, whether the system
will find the simple answer `(married Minnie Mickey)' before it goes
into the loop depends on implementation details concerning the order in
which the system checks the items in the data base.  This is a very
simple example of the kinds of loops that can occur.  Collections of
interrelated rules can lead to loops that are much harder to
anticipate, and the appearance of a loop can depend on the order of
clauses in an `and' (see *Note Exercise 4-64::) or on low-level details
concerning the order in which the system processes queries.(3)
</p>

<p>
Problems with `not'
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
Another quirk in the query system concerns `not'.  Given the data base
of section *Note 4-4-1::, consider the following two queries:
</p>

<p>
(and (supervisor ?x ?y)
     (not (job ?x (computer programmer))))
</p>

<p>
(and (not (job ?x (computer programmer)))
     (supervisor ?x ?y))
</p>

<p>
   These two queries do not produce the same result.  The first query
begins by finding all entries in the data base that match `(supervisor
?x ?y)', and then filters the resulting frames by removing the ones in
which the value of `?x' satisfies `(job ?x (computer programmer))'.
The second query begins by filtering the incoming frames to remove
those that can satisfy `(job ?x (computer programmer))'.  Since the
only incoming frame is empty, it checks the data base to see if there
are any patterns that satisfy `(job ?x (computer programmer))'.  Since
there generally are entries of this form, the `not' clause filters out
the empty frame and returns an empty stream of frames.  Consequently,
the entire compound query returns an empty stream.
</p>

<p>
   The trouble is that our implementation of `not' really is meant to
serve as a filter on values for the variables.  If a `not' clause is
processed with a frame in which some of the variables remain unbound
(as does `?x' in the example above), the system will produce unexpected
results. Similar problems occur with the use of `lisp-value'&#x2013;the Lisp
predicate can't work if some of its arguments are unbound.  See *Note
Exercise 4-77::.
</p>

<p>
   There is also a much more serious way in which the `not' of the query
language differs from the `not' of mathematical logic.  In logic, we
interpret the statement "not P" to mean that P is not true.  In the
query system, however, "not P" means that P is not deducible from the
knowledge in the data base.  For example, given the personnel data base
of section *Note 4-4-1::, the system would happily deduce all sorts of
`not' statements, such as that Ben Bitdiddle is not a baseball fan,
that it is not raining outside, and that 2 + 2 is not 4.(4) In other
words, the `not' of logic programming languages reflects the so-called "closed
world assumption" that all relevant information has been included in
the data base.(5)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.64:</b> Louis Reasoner mistakenly deletes the
`outranked-by' rule (section *Note 4-4-1::) from the data base.
When he realizes this, he quickly reinstalls it.  Unfortunately,
he makes a slight change in the rule, and types it in as
</p>

<p>
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
	  (and (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
	       (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager))))
</p>

<p>
Just after Louis types this information into the system, DeWitt
Aull comes by to find out who outranks Ben Bitdiddle. He issues
the query
</p>

<p>
(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) ?who)
</p>

<p>
After answering, the system goes into an infinite loop.  Explain
why.

<b>Exercise 4.65:</b> Cy D. Fect, looking forward to the day when he
will rise in the organization, gives a query to find all the
wheels (using the `wheel' rule of section *Note 4-4-1::):

<p>
(wheel ?who)
</p>

<p>
To his surprise, the system responds
</p>

<p>
;;; Query results:
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Bitdiddle Ben))

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.66:</b> Ben has been generalizing the query system to

total salaries of all the computer programmers one will be able to
say
</p>

<p>
(sum ?amount

	  (salary ?x ?amount)))
</p>

<p>
In general, Ben's new system allows expressions of the form
</p>

<p>

		       &lt;QUERY PATTERN&gt;)
</p>

<p>
where `accumulation-function' can be things like `sum', `average',
or `maximum'.  Ben reasons that it should be a cinch to implement
this.  He will simply feed the query pattern to `qeval'.  This
will produce a stream of frames.  He will then pass this stream
through a mapping function that extracts the value of the
designated variable from each frame in the stream and feed the
resulting stream of values to the accumulation function.  Just as
Ben completes the implementation and is about to try it out, Cy
walks by, still puzzling over the `wheel' query result in exercise
*Note Exercise 4-65::.  When Cy shows Ben the system's response,
Ben groans, "Oh, no, my simple accumulation scheme won't work!"

<b>Exercise 4.67:</b> Devise a way to install a loop detector in the

in the text and in *Note Exercise 4-64::.  The general idea is that
the system should maintain some sort of history of its current
chain of deductions and should not begin processing a query that
it is already working on.  Describe what kind of information
(patterns and frames) is included in this history, and how the
check should be made.  (After you study the details of the

to modify the system to include your loop detector.)

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.69:</b> Beginning with the data base and the rules you

and Jubal are the great-great-great-great-great-grandsons of Adam.
(Hint: Represent the fact about Irad, for example, as `((great
grandson) Adam Irad)'.  Write rules that determine if a list ends
in the word `grandson'.  Use this to express a rule that allows
one to derive the relationship `((great .  ?rel) ?x ?y)', where
`?rel' is a list ending in `grandson'.)  Check your rules on
queries such as `((great grandson) ?g ?ggs)' and `(?relationship
Adam Irad)'.

<p>
   (1) That a particular method of inference is legitimate is not a
trivial assertion.  One must prove that if one starts with true
premises, only true conclusions can be derived.  The method of
inference represented by rule applications is "modus ponens", the
familiar method of inference that says that if A is true and <span class="underline">A implies
B</span> is true, then we may conclude that B is true.
</p>

<p>
   (2) We must qualify this statement by agreeing that, in speaking of
the "inference" accomplished by a logic program, we assume that the
computation terminates.  Unfortunately, even this qualified statement
is false for our implementation of the query language (and also false
for programs in Prolog and most other current logic programming
languages) because of our use of `not' and `lisp-value'.  As we will
describe below, the `not' implemented in the query language is not
always consistent with the `not' of mathematical logic, and
`lisp-value' introduces additional complications.  We could implement a
language consistent with mathematical logic by simply removing `not'
and `lisp-value' from the language and agreeing to write programs using
only simple queries, `and', and `or'.  However, this would greatly
restrict the expressive power of the language.  One of the major
concerns of research in logic programming is to find ways to achieve
more consistency with mathematical logic without unduly sacrificing
expressive power.
</p>

<p>
   (3) This is not a problem of the logic but one of the procedural
interpretation of the logic provided by our interpreter.  We could
write an interpreter that would not fall into a loop here.  For
example, we could enumerate all the proofs derivable from our
assertions and our rules in a breadth-first rather than a depth-first
order.  However, such a system makes it more difficult to take
advantage of the order of deductions in our programs.  One attempt to
build sophisticated control into such a program is described in deKleer
et al. 1977.  Another technique, which does not lead to such serious
control problems, is to put in special knowledge, such as detectors for
particular kinds of loops (*Note Exercise 4-67::).  However, there can
be no general scheme for reliably preventing a system from going down
infinite paths in performing deductions.  Imagine a diabolical rule of
the form "To show P(x) is true, show that P(f(x)) is true," for some
suitably chosen function f.
</p>

<p>
   (4) Consider the query `(not (baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben)))'.  The
system finds that `(baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben))' is not in the data
base, so the empty frame does not satisfy the pattern and is not
filtered out of the initial stream of frames.  The result of the query
is thus the empty frame, which is used to instantiate the input query
to produce `(not (baseball-fan (Bitdiddle Ben)))'.
</p>

<p>
   (5) A discussion and justification of this treatment of `not' can be
found in the article by Clark (1978).

4.4.4.1 The Driver Loop and Instantiation
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The driver loop for the query system repeatedly reads input
expressions.  If the expression is a rule or assertion to be added to
the data base, then the information is added.  Otherwise the expression
is assumed to be a query.  The driver passes this query to the
evaluator `qeval' together with an initial frame stream consisting of a
single empty frame.  The result of the evaluation is a stream of frames
generated by satisfying the query with variable values found in the
data base.  These frames are used to form a new stream consisting of
copies of the original query in which the variables are instantiated
with values supplied by the stream of frames, and this final stream is
printed at the terminal:
</p>

<p>
(define input-prompt ";;; Query input:")
(define output-prompt ";;; Query results:")
</p>

<p>
(define (query-driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let ((q (query-syntax-process (read))))
    (cond ((assertion-to-be-added? q)
	   (add-rule-or-assertion! (add-assertion-body q))
	   (newline)
	   (display "Assertion added to data base.")
	   (query-driver-loop))
	  (else
	   (newline)
	   (display output-prompt)
	   (display-stream
	    (stream-map
	     (lambda (frame)
	       (instantiate q
			    frame
			    (lambda (v f)
			      (contract-question-mark v))))
	     (qeval q (singleton-stream '()))))
	   (query-driver-loop)))))
</p>

<p>
   Here, as in the other evaluators in this chapter, we use an abstract
syntax for the expressions of the query language.  The implementation
of the expression syntax, including the predicate
`assertion-to-be-added?' and the selector `add-assertion-body', is
given in section *Note 4-4-4-7::.  `Add-rule-or-assertion!' is defined
in section *Note 4-4-4-5::.
</p>

<p>
   Before doing any processing on an input expression, the driver loop
transforms it syntactically into a form that makes the processing more
efficient.  This involves changing the representation of pattern
variables.  When the query is instantiated, any variables that remain
unbound are transformed back to the input representation before being
printed.  These transformations are performed by the two procedures
`query-syntax-process' and `contract-question-mark' (section *Note
4-4-4-7::).
</p>

<p>
   To instantiate an expression, we copy it, replacing any variables in
the expression by their values in a given frame.  The values are
themselves instantiated, since they could contain variables (for
example, if `?x' in `exp' is bound to `?y' as the result of unification
and `?y' is in turn bound to 5).  The action to take if a variable
cannot be instantiated is given by a procedural argument to
`instantiate'.
</p>

<p>
(define (instantiate exp frame unbound-var-handler)
  (define (copy exp)
    (cond ((var? exp)
	   (let ((binding (binding-in-frame exp frame)))
	     (if binding
		 (copy (binding-value binding))
		 (unbound-var-handler exp frame))))
	  ((pair? exp)
	   (cons (copy (car exp)) (copy (cdr exp))))
	  (else exp)))
  (copy exp))

4.4.4.2 The Evaluator
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The `qeval' procedure, called by the `query-driver-loop', is the basic
evaluator of the query system.  It takes as inputs a query and a stream
of frames, and it returns a stream of extended frames.  It identifies
special forms by a data-directed dispatch using `get' and `put', just
as we did in implementing generic operations in *Note Chapter 2::.  Any
query that is not identified as a special form is assumed to be a
simple query, to be processed by `simple-query'.
</p>

<p>
(define (qeval query frame-stream)
  (let ((qproc (get (type query) 'qeval)))
    (if qproc
	(qproc (contents query) frame-stream)
	(simple-query query frame-stream))))
</p>

<p>
   `Type' and `contents', defined in section *Note 4-4-4-7::, implement
the abstract syntax of the special forms.
</p>

<p>
Simple queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
The `simple-query' procedure handles simple queries.  It takes as
arguments a simple query (a pattern) together with a stream of frames,
and it returns the stream formed by extending each frame by all
data-base matches of the query.
</p>

<p>
(define (simple-query query-pattern frame-stream)
  (stream-flatmap
   (lambda (frame)
     (stream-append-delayed
      (find-assertions query-pattern frame)
      (delay (apply-rules query-pattern frame))))
   frame-stream))
</p>

<p>
   For each frame in the input stream, we use `find-assertions' (section
*Note 4-4-4-3::) to match the pattern against all assertions in the
data base, producing a stream of extended frames, and we use
`apply-rules' (section *Note 4-4-4-4::) to apply all possible rules,
producing another stream of extended frames.  These two streams are
combined (using `stream-append-delayed', section *Note 4-4-4-6::) to
make a stream of all the ways that the given pattern can be satisfied
consistent with the original frame (see *Note Exercise 4-71::).  The
streams for the individual input frames are combined using
`stream-flatmap' (section *Note 4-4-4-6::) to form one large stream of
all the ways that any of the frames in the original input stream can be
extended to produce a match with the given pattern.
</p>

<p>
Compound queries
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
`And' queries are handled as illustrated in *Note Figure 4-5:: by the
`conjoin' procedure.  `Conjoin' takes as inputs the conjuncts and the
frame stream and returns the stream of extended frames.  First,
`conjoin' processes the stream of frames to find the stream of all
possible frame extensions that satisfy the first query in the
conjunction.  Then, using this as the new frame stream, it recursively
applies `conjoin' to the rest of the queries.
</p>

<p>
(define (conjoin conjuncts frame-stream)
  (if (empty-conjunction? conjuncts)
      frame-stream
      (conjoin (rest-conjuncts conjuncts)
	       (qeval (first-conjunct conjuncts)
		      frame-stream))))
</p>

<p>
The expression
</p>

<p>
(put 'and 'qeval conjoin)
</p>

<p>
sets up `qeval' to dispatch to `conjoin' when an `and' form is
encountered.
</p>

<p>
   `Or' queries are handled similarly, as shown in *Note Figure 4-6::.
The output streams for the various disjuncts of the `or' are computed
separately and merged using the `interleave-delayed' procedure from
section *Note 4-4-4-6::.  (See *Note Exercise 4-71:: and *Note Exercise
4-72::.)
</p>

<p>
(define (disjoin disjuncts frame-stream)
  (if (empty-disjunction? disjuncts)
      the-empty-stream
      (interleave-delayed
       (qeval (first-disjunct disjuncts) frame-stream)
       (delay (disjoin (rest-disjuncts disjuncts)
		       frame-stream)))))
</p>

<p>
(put 'or 'qeval disjoin)
</p>

<p>
   The predicates and selectors for the syntax of conjuncts and
disjuncts are given in section *Note 4-4-4-7::.
</p>

<p>
Filters
&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
`Not' is handled by the method outlined in section *Note 4-4-2::.  We
attempt to extend each frame in the input stream to satisfy the query
being negated, and we include a given frame in the output stream only
if it cannot be extended.
</p>

<p>
(define (negate operands frame-stream)
  (stream-flatmap
   (lambda (frame)
     (if (stream-null? (qeval (negated-query operands)
			      (singleton-stream frame)))
	 (singleton-stream frame)
	 the-empty-stream))
   frame-stream))
</p>

<p>
(put 'not 'qeval negate)
</p>

<p>
   `Lisp-value' is a filter similar to `not'.  Each frame in the stream
is used to instantiate the variables in the pattern, the indicated
predicate is applied, and the frames for which the predicate returns
false are filtered out of the input stream.  An error results if there
are unbound pattern variables.
</p>

<p>
(define (lisp-value call frame-stream)
  (stream-flatmap
   (lambda (frame)
     (if (execute
	  (instantiate
	   call
	   frame
	   (lambda (v f)
	     (error "Unknown pat var &#x2013; LISP-VALUE" v))))
	 (singleton-stream frame)
	 the-empty-stream))
   frame-stream))
</p>

<p>
(put 'lisp-value 'qeval lisp-value)
</p>

<p>
   `Execute', which applies the predicate to the arguments, must `eval'
the predicate expression to get the procedure to apply.  However, it
must not evaluate the arguments, since they are already the actual
arguments, not expressions whose evaluation (in Lisp) will produce the
arguments.  Note that `execute' is implemented using `eval' and `apply'
from the underlying Lisp system.
</p>

<p>
(define (execute exp)
  (apply (eval (predicate exp) user-initial-environment)
	 (args exp)))
</p>

<p>
   The `always-true' special form provides for a query that is always
satisfied.  It ignores its contents (normally empty) and simply passes
through all the frames in the input stream.  `Always-true' is used by
the `rule-body' selector (section *Note 4-4-4-7::) to provide bodies
for rules that were defined without bodies (that is, rules whose
conclusions are always satisfied).
</p>

<p>
(define (always-true ignore frame-stream) frame-stream)
</p>

<p>
(put 'always-true 'qeval always-true)
</p>

<p>
   The selectors that define the syntax of `not' and `lisp-value' are
given in section *Note 4-4-4-7::.

4.4.4.3 Finding Assertions by Pattern Matching
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
`Find-assertions', called by `simple-query' (section *Note 4-4-4-2::),
takes as input a pattern and a frame.  It returns a stream of frames,
each extending the given one by a data-base match of the given pattern.
It uses `fetch-assertions' (section *Note 4-4-4-5::) to get a stream
of all the assertions in the data base that should be checked for a
match against the pattern and the frame.  The reason for
`fetch-assertions' here is that we can often apply simple tests that
will eliminate many of the entries in the data base from the pool of
candidates for a successful match.  The system would still work if we
eliminated `fetch-assertions' and simply checked a stream of all
assertions in the data base, but the computation would be less efficient
because we would need to make many more calls to the matcher.
</p>

<p>
(define (find-assertions pattern frame)
  (stream-flatmap (lambda (datum)
		    (check-an-assertion datum pattern frame))
		  (fetch-assertions pattern frame)))
</p>

<p>
   `Check-an-assertion' takes as arguments a pattern, a data object
(assertion), and a frame and returns either a one-element stream
containing the extended frame or `the-empty-stream' if the match fails.
</p>

<p>
(define (check-an-assertion assertion query-pat query-frame)
  (let ((match-result
	 (pattern-match query-pat assertion query-frame)))
    (if (eq? match-result 'failed)
	the-empty-stream
	(singleton-stream match-result))))
</p>

<p>
   The basic pattern matcher returns either the symbol `failed' or an
extension of the given frame.  The basic idea of the matcher is to
check the pattern against the data, element by element, accumulating
bindings for the pattern variables.  If the pattern and the data object
are the same, the match succeeds and we return the frame of bindings
accumulated so far.  Otherwise, if the pattern is a variable we extend
the current frame by binding the variable to the data, so long as this
is consistent with the bindings already in the frame.  If the pattern
and the data are both pairs, we (recursively) match the `car' of the
pattern against the `car' of the data to produce a frame; in this frame
we then match the `cdr' of the pattern against the `cdr' of the data.
If none of these cases are applicable, the match fails and we return
the symbol `failed'.
</p>

<p>
(define (pattern-match pat dat frame)
  (cond ((eq? frame 'failed) 'failed)
	((equal? pat dat) frame)
	((var? pat) (extend-if-consistent pat dat frame))
	((and (pair? pat) (pair? dat))
	 (pattern-match (cdr pat)
			(cdr dat)
			(pattern-match (car pat)
				       (car dat)
				       frame)))
	(else 'failed)))
</p>

<p>
   Here is the procedure that extends a frame by adding a new binding,
if this is consistent with the bindings already in the frame:
</p>

<p>
(define (extend-if-consistent var dat frame)
  (let ((binding (binding-in-frame var frame)))
    (if binding
	(pattern-match (binding-value binding) dat frame)
	(extend var dat frame))))
</p>

<p>
   If there is no binding for the variable in the frame, we simply add
the binding of the variable to the data.  Otherwise we match, in the
frame, the data against the value of the variable in the frame.  If the
stored value contains only constants, as it must if it was stored
during pattern matching by `extend-if-consistent', then the match
simply tests whether the stored and new values are the same.  If so, it
returns the unmodified frame; if not, it returns a failure indication.
The stored value may, however, contain pattern variables if it was
stored during unification (see section *Note 4-4-4-4::).  The recursive
match of the stored pattern against the new data will add or check
bindings for the variables in this pattern.  For example, suppose we
have a frame in which `?x' is bound to `(f ?y)' and `?y' is unbound,
and we wish to augment this frame by a binding of `?x' to `(f b)'.  We
look up `?x' and find that it is bound to `(f ?y)'.  This leads us to
match `(f ?y)' against the proposed new value `(f b)' in the same
frame.  Eventually this match extends the frame by adding a binding of
`?y' to `b'.  `?X' remains bound to `(f ?y)'.  We never modify a stored
binding and we never store more than one binding for a given variable.
</p>

<p>
   The procedures used by `extend-if-consistent' to manipulate bindings
are defined in section *Note 4-4-4-8::.
</p>

<p>
Patterns with dotted tails
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
If a pattern contains a dot followed by a pattern variable, the pattern
variable matches the rest of the data list (rather than the next
element of the data list), just as one would expect with the
dotted-tail notation described in *Note Exercise 2-20::.  Although the
pattern matcher we have just implemented doesn't look for dots, it does
behave as we want.  This is because the Lisp `read' primitive, which is
used by `query-driver-loop' to read the query and represent it as a
list structure, treats dots in a special way.
</p>

<p>
   When `read' sees a dot, instead of making the next item be the next
element of a list (the `car' of a `cons' whose `cdr' will be the rest
of the list) it makes the next item be the `cdr' of the list structure.
For example, the list structure produced by `read' for the pattern
`(computer ?type)' could be constructed by evaluating the expression
`(cons 'computer (cons '?type '()))', and that for `(computer . ?type)'
could be constructed by evaluating the expression `(cons 'computer
'?type)'.
</p>

<p>
   Thus, as `pattern-match' recursively compares `car's and `cdr's of a
data list and a pattern that had a dot, it eventually matches the
variable after the dot (which is a `cdr' of the pattern) against a
sublist of the data list, binding the variable to that list.  For
example, matching the pattern `(computer . ?type)' against `(computer
programmer trainee)' will match `?type' against the list `(programmer
trainee)'.

4.4.4.4 Rules and Unification
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..
</p>

<p>
`Apply-rules' is the rule analog of `find-assertions' (section *Note
4-4-4-3::).  It takes as input a pattern and a frame, and it forms a
stream of extension frames by applying rules from the data base.
`Stream-flatmap' maps `apply-a-rule' down the stream of possibly
applicable rules (selected by `fetch-rules', section *Note 4-4-4-5::)
and combines the resulting streams of frames.
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-rules pattern frame)
  (stream-flatmap (lambda (rule)
		    (apply-a-rule rule pattern frame))
		  (fetch-rules pattern frame)))
</p>

<p>
   `Apply-a-rule' applies rules using the method outlined in section
*Note 4-4-2::.  It first augments its argument frame by unifying the
rule conclusion with the pattern in the given frame.  If this succeeds,
it evaluates the rule body in this new frame.
</p>

<p>
   Before any of this happens, however, the program renames all the
variables in the rule with unique new names.  The reason for this is to
prevent the variables for different rule applications from becoming
confused with each other.  For instance, if two rules both use a
variable named `?x', then each one may add a binding for `?x' to the
frame when it is applied.  These two `?x''s have nothing to do with
each other, and we should not be fooled into thinking that the two
bindings must be consistent.  Rather than rename variables, we could
devise a more clever environment structure; however, the renaming
approach we have chosen here is the most straightforward, even if not
the most efficient.  (See *Note Exercise 4-79::.)  Here is the
`apply-a-rule' procedure:
</p>

<p>
(define (apply-a-rule rule query-pattern query-frame)
  (let ((clean-rule (rename-variables-in rule)))
    (let ((unify-result
	   (unify-match query-pattern
			(conclusion clean-rule)
			query-frame)))
      (if (eq? unify-result 'failed)
	  the-empty-stream
	  (qeval (rule-body clean-rule)
		 (singleton-stream unify-result))))))
</p>

<p>
   The selectors `rule-body' and `conclusion' that extract parts of a
rule are defined in section *Note 4-4-4-7::.
</p>

<p>
   We generate unique variable names by associating a unique identifier
(such as a number) with each rule application and combining this
identifier with the original variable names.  For example, if the
rule-application identifier is 7, we might change each `?x' in the rule
to `?x-7' and each `?y' in the rule to `?y-7'.  (`Make-new-variable' and
`new-rule-application-id' are included with the syntax procedures in
section *Note 4-4-4-7::.)
</p>

<p>
(define (rename-variables-in rule)
  (let ((rule-application-id (new-rule-application-id)))
    (define (tree-walk exp)
      (cond ((var? exp)
	     (make-new-variable exp rule-application-id))
	    ((pair? exp)
	     (cons (tree-walk (car exp))
		   (tree-walk (cdr exp))))
	    (else exp)))
    (tree-walk rule)))
</p>

<p>
   The unification algorithm is implemented as a procedure that takes
as inputs two patterns and a frame and returns either the extended
frame or the symbol `failed'.  The unifier is like the pattern matcher
except that it is symmetrical&#x2013;variables are allowed on both sides of
the match.  `Unify-match' is basically the same as `pattern-match',
except that there is extra code (marked "`***'" below) to handle the
case where the object on the right side of the match is a variable.
</p>

<p>
(define (unify-match p1 p2 frame)
  (cond ((eq? frame 'failed) 'failed)
	((equal? p1 p2) frame)
	((var? p1) (extend-if-possible p1 p2 frame))
	((var? p2) (extend-if-possible p2 p1 frame))  ; <b>*</b>
	((and (pair? p1) (pair? p2))
	 (unify-match (cdr p1)
		      (cdr p2)
		      (unify-match (car p1)
				   (car p2)
				   frame)))
	(else 'failed)))
</p>

<p>
   In unification, as in one-sided pattern matching, we want to accept
a proposed extension of the frame only if it is consistent with
existing bindings.  The procedure `extend-if-possible' used in
unification is the same as the `extend-if-consistent' used in pattern
matching except for two special checks, marked "`***'" in the program
below.  In the first case, if the variable we are trying to match is
not bound, but the value we are trying to match it with is itself a
(different) variable, it is necessary to check to see if the value is
bound, and if so, to match its value.  If both parties to the match are
unbound, we may bind either to the other.
</p>

<p>
   The second check deals with attempts to bind a variable to a pattern
that includes that variable.  Such a situation can occur whenever a
variable is repeated in both patterns.  Consider, for example, unifying
the two patterns `(?x ?x)' and `(?y &lt;EXPRESSION INVOLVING `?Y'&gt;)' in a
frame where both `?x' and `?y' are unbound.  First `?x' is matched
against `?y', making a binding of `?x' to `?y'.  Next, the same `?x' is
matched against the given expression involving `?y'.  Since `?x' is
already bound to `?y', this results in matching `?y' against the
expression.  If we think of the unifier as finding a set of values for
the pattern variables that make the patterns the same, then these
patterns imply instructions to find a `?y' such that `?y' is equal to
the expression involving `?y'.  There is no general method for solving
such equations, so we reject such bindings; these cases are recognized
by the predicate `depends-on?'.(1)  On the other hand, we do not want
to reject attempts to bind a variable to itself.  For example, consider
unifying `(?x ?x)' and `(?y ?y)'.  The second attempt to bind `?x' to
`?y' matches `?y' (the stored value of `?x') against `?y' (the new
value of `?x').  This is taken care of by the `equal?'  clause of
`unify-match'.
</p>

<p>
(define (extend-if-possible var val frame)
  (let ((binding (binding-in-frame var frame)))

</p>

<p>
   `Depends-on?' is a predicate that tests whether an expression
proposed to be the value of a pattern variable depends on the variable.
This must be done relative to the current frame because the expression
may contain occurrences of a variable that already has a value that
depends on our test variable.  The structure of `depends-on?' is a
simple recursive tree walk in which we substitute for the values of
variables whenever necessary.
</p>

<p>
(define (depends-on? exp var frame)
  (define (tree-walk e)
    (cond ((var? e)
	   (if (equal? var e)
	       true
	       (let ((b (binding-in-frame e frame)))
		 (if b
		     (tree-walk (binding-value b))
		     false))))
	  ((pair? e)
	   (or (tree-walk (car e))
	       (tree-walk (cdr e))))
	  (else false)))
  (tree-walk exp))

   (1) In general, unifying `?y' with an expression involving `?y'
would require our being able to find a fixed point of the equation `?y'
= &lt;EXPRESSION INVOLVING `?Y'&gt;.  It is sometimes possible to
syntactically form an expression that appears to be the solution.  For
example, `?y' = `(f ?y)' seems to have the fixed point `(f (f (f &#x2026;
)))', which we can produce by beginning with the expression `(f ?y)'
and repeatedly substituting `(f ?y)' for `?y'.  Unfortunately, not
every such equation has a meaningful fixed point.  The issues that
arise here are similar to the issues of manipulating infinite series in
mathematics.  For example, we know that 2 is the solution to the
equation y = 1 + y/2.  Beginning with the expression 1 + y/2 and
repeatedly substituting 1 + y/2 for y gives
</p>

<p>
2 = y = 1 + y/2 = 1 + (1 + y/2)/2 = 1 + 1/2 + y/4 = &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
which leads to
</p>

<p>
2 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
However, if we try the same manipulation beginning with the observation
that - 1 is the solution to the equation y = 1 + 2y, we obtain
</p>

<p>
-1 = y = 1 + 2y = 1 + 2(1 + 2y) = 1 + 2 + 4y = &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
which leads to
</p>

<p>
-1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Although the formal manipulations used in deriving these two equations
are identical, the first result is a valid assertion about infinite
series but the second is not.  Similarly, for our unification results,
reasoning with an arbitrary syntactically constructed expression may
lead to errors.

4.4.4.5 Maintaining the Data Base
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
One important problem in designing logic programming languages is that
of arranging things so that as few irrelevant data-base entries as
possible will be examined in checking a given pattern.  In our system,
in addition to storing all assertions in one big stream, we store all
assertions whose `car's are constant symbols in separate streams, in a
table indexed by the symbol.  To fetch an assertion that may match a
pattern, we first check to see if the `car' of the pattern is a
constant symbol.  If so, we return (to be tested using the matcher) all
the stored assertions that have the same `car'.  If the pattern's `car'
is not a constant symbol, we return all the stored assertions.
Cleverer methods could also take advantage of information in the frame,
or try also to optimize the case where the `car' of the pattern is not
a constant symbol.  We avoid building our criteria for indexing (using
the `car', handling only the case of constant symbols) into the program;
instead we call on predicates and selectors that embody our criteria.
</p>

<p>
(define THE-ASSERTIONS the-empty-stream)
</p>

<p>
(define (fetch-assertions pattern frame)
  (if (use-index? pattern)
      (get-indexed-assertions pattern)
      (get-all-assertions)))
</p>

<p>
(define (get-all-assertions) THE-ASSERTIONS)
</p>

<p>
(define (get-indexed-assertions pattern)
  (get-stream (index-key-of pattern) 'assertion-stream))
</p>

<p>
   `Get-stream' looks up a stream in the table and returns an empty
stream if nothing is stored there.
</p>

<p>
(define (get-stream key1 key2)
  (let ((s (get key1 key2)))
    (if s s the-empty-stream)))
</p>

<p>
   Rules are stored similarly, using the `car' of the rule conclusion.
Rule conclusions are arbitrary patterns, however, so they differ from
assertions in that they can contain variables.  A pattern whose `car'
is a constant symbol can match rules whose conclusions start with a
variable as well as rules whose conclusions have the same `car'.  Thus,
when fetching rules that might match a pattern whose `car' is a
constant symbol we fetch all rules whose conclusions start with a
variable as well as those whose conclusions have the same `car' as the
pattern.  For this purpose we store all rules whose conclusions start
with a variable in a separate stream in our table, indexed by the
symbol `?'.
</p>

<p>
(define THE-RULES the-empty-stream)
</p>

<p>

   (get-stream '? 'rule-stream)))
</p>

<p>
   `Add-rule-or-assertion!' is used by `query-driver-loop' to add
assertions and rules to the data base.  Each item is stored in the
index, if appropriate, and in a stream of all assertions or rules in
the data base.
</p>

<p>
(define (add-rule-or-assertion! assertion)
  (if (rule? assertion)
      (add-rule! assertion)
      (add-assertion! assertion)))
</p>

<p>
(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)

  (store-rule-in-index rule)
  (let ((old-rules THE-RULES))
    (set! THE-RULES (cons-stream rule old-rules))
    'ok))
</p>

<p>
   To actually store an assertion or a rule, we check to see if it can
be indexed.  If so, we store it in the appropriate stream.
</p>

<p>
(define (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (if (indexable? assertion)
      (let ((key (index-key-of assertion)))
	(let ((current-assertion-stream
	       (get-stream key 'assertion-stream)))
	  (put key
	       'assertion-stream
	       (cons-stream assertion
			    current-assertion-stream))))))
</p>

<p>
(define (store-rule-in-index rule)
  (let ((pattern (conclusion rule)))
    (if (indexable? pattern)
	(let ((key (index-key-of pattern)))
	  (let ((current-rule-stream
		 (get-stream key 'rule-stream)))
	    (put key
		 'rule-stream
		 (cons-stream rule
			      current-rule-stream)))))))
</p>

<p>
   The following procedures define how the data-base index is used.  A
pattern (an assertion or a rule conclusion) will be stored in the table
if it starts with a variable or a constant symbol.
</p>

<p>
(define (indexable? pat)
  (or (constant-symbol? (car pat))
      (var? (car pat))))
</p>

<p>
   The key under which a pattern is stored in the table is either `?'
(if it starts with a variable) or the constant symbol with which it
starts.
</p>

<p>
(define (index-key-of pat)
  (let ((key (car pat)))
    (if (var? key) '? key)))
</p>

<p>
   The index will be used to retrieve items that might match a pattern
if the pattern starts with a constant symbol.

4.4.4.6 Stream Operations
&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.
</p>

<p>
The query system uses a few stream operations that were not presented in
*Note Chapter 3::.
</p>

<p>
   `Stream-append-delayed' and `interleave-delayed' are just like
`stream-append' and `interleave' (section *Note 3-5-3::), except that
they take a delayed argument (like the `integral' procedure in section
*Note 3-5-4::).  This postpones looping in some cases (see *Note
Exercise 4-71::).
</p>

<p>
(define (stream-append-delayed s1 delayed-s2)
  (if (stream-null? s1)
      (force delayed-s2)
      (cons-stream
       (stream-car s1)
       (stream-append-delayed (stream-cdr s1) delayed-s2))))
</p>

<p>
(define (interleave-delayed s1 delayed-s2)
  (if (stream-null? s1)
      (force delayed-s2)
      (cons-stream
       (stream-car s1)
       (interleave-delayed (force delayed-s2)
			   (delay (stream-cdr s1))))))
</p>

<p>
   `Stream-flatmap', which is used throughout the query evaluator to
map a procedure over a stream of frames and combine the resulting
streams of frames, is the stream analog of the `flatmap' procedure
introduced for ordinary lists in section *Note 2-2-3::.  Unlike
ordinary `flatmap', however, we accumulate the streams with an
interleaving process, rather than simply appending them (see *Note
Exercise 4-72:: and *Note Exercise 4-73::).
</p>

<p>
(define (stream-flatmap proc s)
  (flatten-stream (stream-map proc s)))
</p>

<p>
(define (flatten-stream stream)
  (if (stream-null? stream)
      the-empty-stream
      (interleave-delayed
       (stream-car stream)
       (delay (flatten-stream (stream-cdr stream))))))
</p>

<p>
   The evaluator also uses the following simple procedure to generate a
stream consisting of a single element:
</p>

<p>
(define (singleton-stream x)
  (cons-stream x the-empty-stream))
</p>

<p>
`Type' and `contents', used by `qeval' (section *Note 4-4-4-2::),
specify that a special form is identified by the symbol in its `car'.
They are the same as the `type-tag' and `contents' procedures in
section *Note 2-4-2::, except for the error message.
</p>

<p>

(define (contents exp)
  (if (pair? exp)
      (cdr exp)
      (error "Unknown expression CONTENTS" exp)))
</p>

<p>
   The following procedures, used by `query-driver-loop' (in section
*Note 4-4-4-1::), specify that rules and assertions are added to the
data base by expressions of the form `(assert! &lt;RULE-OR-ASSERTION&gt;)':
</p>

<p>
(define (assertion-to-be-added? exp)
  (eq? (type exp) 'assert!))
</p>

<p>
(define (add-assertion-body exp)
  (car (contents exp)))
</p>

<p>
   Here are the syntax definitions for the `and', `or', `not', and
`lisp-value' special forms (section *Note 4-4-4-2::):
</p>

<p>
(define (empty-conjunction? exps) (null? exps))
(define (first-conjunct exps) (car exps))
(define (rest-conjuncts exps) (cdr exps))
</p>

<p>
(define (empty-disjunction? exps) (null? exps))
(define (first-disjunct exps) (car exps))
(define (rest-disjuncts exps) (cdr exps))
</p>

<p>
(define (negated-query exps) (car exps))
</p>

<p>
(define (predicate exps) (car exps))
(define (args exps) (cdr exps))
</p>

<p>
The following three procedures define the syntax of rules:
</p>

<p>
(define (rule? statement)
  (tagged-list? statement 'rule))
</p>

<p>
(define (conclusion rule) (cadr rule))
</p>

<p>
(define (rule-body rule)
  (if (null? (cddr rule))
      '(always-true)
      (caddr rule)))
</p>

<p>
   `Query-driver-loop' (section *Note 4-4-4-1::) calls
`query-syntax-process' to transform pattern variables in the expression,
which have the form `?symbol', into the internal format `(? symbol)'.
That is to say, a pattern such as `(job ?x ?y)' is actually represented
internally by the system as `(job (? x) (? y))'.  This increases the
efficiency of query processing, since it means that the system can
check to see if an expression is a pattern variable by checking whether
the `car' of the expression is the symbol `?', rather than having to
extract characters from the symbol.  The syntax transformation is
accomplished by the following procedure:(1)
</p>

<p>
(define (query-syntax-process exp)
  (map-over-symbols expand-question-mark exp))
</p>

<p>
(define (map-over-symbols proc exp)
  (cond ((pair? exp)
	 (cons (map-over-symbols proc (car exp))
	       (map-over-symbols proc (cdr exp))))
	((symbol? exp) (proc exp))
	(else exp)))
</p>

<p>
(define (expand-question-mark symbol)
  (let ((chars (symbol-&gt;string symbol)))
    (if (string=? (substring chars 0 1) "?")
	(list '?
	      (string-&gt;symbol
	       (substring chars 1 (string-length chars))))
	symbol)))
</p>

<p>
   Once the variables are transformed in this way, the variables in a
pattern are lists starting with `?', and the constant symbols (which
need to be recognized for data-base indexing, section *Note 4-4-4-5::)
are just the symbols.
</p>

<p>
(define (var? exp)
  (tagged-list? exp '?))
</p>

<p>
(define (constant-symbol? exp) (symbol? exp))
</p>

<p>
   Unique variables are constructed during rule application (in section
*Note 4-4-4-4::) by means of the following procedures.  The unique
identifier for a rule application is a number, which is incremented
each time a rule is applied.
</p>

<p>
(define rule-counter 0)
</p>

<p>
(define (new-rule-application-id)
  (set! rule-counter (+ 1 rule-counter))
  rule-counter)
</p>

<p>
(define (make-new-variable var rule-application-id)
  (cons '? (cons rule-application-id (cdr var))))
</p>

<p>
   When `query-driver-loop' instantiates the query to print the answer,
it converts any unbound pattern variables back to the right form for
printing, using
</p>

<p>
(define (contract-question-mark variable)
  (string-&gt;symbol
   (string-append "?"
     (if (number? (cadr variable))

<p>
   (1) Most Lisp systems give the user the ability to modify the
ordinary `read' procedure to perform such transformations by defining "reader
macro characters".  Quoted expressions are already handled in this way:
The reader automatically translates `'expression' into `(quote
expression)' before the evaluator sees it.  We could arrange for
`?expression' to be transformed into `(? expression)' in the same way;
however, for the sake of clarity we have included the transformation
procedure here explicitly.

   `Expand-question-mark' and `contract-question-mark' use several

<b>Exercise 4.71:</b> Louis Reasoner wonders why the `simple-query' and
`disjoin' procedures (section *Note 4-4-4-2::) are implemented
using explicit `delay' operations, rather than being defined as

Can you give examples of queries where these simpler definitions
would lead to undesirable behavior?

<b>Exercise 4.74:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker proposes to use a simpler

when combining these streams.

</p>

<p>
(define (simple-flatten stream)
  (stream-map &lt;??&gt;
	      (stream-filter &lt;??&gt; stream)))
</p>

<p>
b. Does the query system's behavior change if we change it in
   this way?
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 4.75:</b> Implement for the query language a new special
form called `unique'.  `Unique' should succeed if there is
precisely one item in the data base satisfying a specified query.
For example,
</p>

<p>
(unique (job ?x (computer wizard)))
</p>

<p>
should print the one-item stream
</p>

<p>
(unique (job (Bitdiddle Ben) (computer wizard)))
</p>

<p>
since Ben is the only computer wizard, and
</p>

<p>
(unique (job ?x (computer programmer)))
</p>

<p>
should print the empty stream, since there is more than one
computer programmer.  Moreover,
</p>

<p>
(and (job ?x ?j) (unique (job ?anyone ?j)))
</p>

<p>
should list all the jobs that are filled by only one person, and
the people who fill them.
</p>

<p>
There are two parts to implementing `unique'.  The first is to
write a procedure that handles this special form, and the second
is to make `qeval' dispatch to that procedure.  The second part is
trivial, since `qeval' does its dispatching in a data-directed
way.  If your procedure is called `uniquely-asserted', all you
need to do is
</p>

<p>
(put 'unique 'qeval uniquely-asserted)
</p>

<p>
and `qeval' will dispatch to this procedure for every query whose
`type' (`car') is the symbol `unique'.
</p>

<p>
The real problem is to write the procedure `uniquely-asserted'.
This should take as input the `contents' (`cdr') of the `unique'
query, together with a stream of frames.  For each frame in the
stream, it should use `qeval' to find the stream of all extensions
to the frame that satisfy the given query.  Any stream that does
not have exactly one item in it should be eliminated.  The
remaining streams should be passed back to be accumulated into one
big stream that is the result of the `unique' query.  This is
similar to the implementation of the `not' special form.
</p>

<p>
Test your implementation by forming a query that lists all people
who supervise precisely one person.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.76:</b> Our implementation of `and' as a series
combination of queries (*Note Figure 4-5::) is elegant, but it is
inefficient because in processing the second query of the `and' we
must scan the data base for each frame produced by the first
query.  If the data base has n elements, and a typical query
produces a number of output frames proportional to n (say n/k),
then scanning the data base for each frame produced by the first
query will require n<sup>2</sup>/k calls to the pattern matcher.  Another
approach would be to process the two clauses of the `and'
separately, then look for all pairs of output frames that are
compatible.  If each query produces n/k output frames, then this
means that we must perform n<sup>2</sup>/k<sup>2</sup> compatibility checks&#x2013;a factor
of k fewer than the number of matches required in our current
method.
</p>

<p>
Devise an implementation of `and' that uses this strategy.  You
must implement a procedure that takes two frames as inputs, checks
whether the bindings in the frames are compatible, and, if so,
produces a frame that merges the two sets of bindings.  This
operation is similar to unification.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.77:</b> In section *Note 4-4-3:: we saw that `not' and
`lisp-value' can cause the query language to give "wrong" answers
if these filtering operations are applied to frames in which
variables are unbound.  Devise a way to fix this shortcoming.  One
idea is to perform the filtering in a "delayed" manner by
appending to the frame a "promise" to filter that is fulfilled
only when enough variables have been bound to make the operation
possible.  We could wait to perform filtering until all other
operations have been performed.  However, for efficiency's sake, we
would like to perform filtering as soon as possible so as to cut
down on the number of intermediate frames generated.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 4.78:</b> Redesign the query language as a nondeterministic
program to be implemented using the evaluator of section *Note
4-3::, rather than as a stream process.  In this approach, each
query will produce a single answer (rather than the stream of all
answers) and the user can type `try-again' to see more answers.
You should find that much of the mechanism we built in this
section is subsumed by nondeterministic search and backtracking.
You will probably also find, however, that your new query language
has subtle differences in behavior from the one implemented here.
Can you find examples that illustrate this difference?

<b>Exercise 4.79:</b> When we implemented the Lisp evaluator in section
*Note 4-1::, we saw how to use local environments to avoid name
conflicts between the parameters of procedures.  For example, in
evaluating
</p>

<p>
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
</p>

<p>
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
</p>

<p>
(sum-of-squares 3 4)
</p>

<p>
there is no confusion between the `x' in `square' and the `x' in
`sum-of-squares', because we evaluate the body of each procedure
in an environment that is specially constructed to contain
bindings for the local variables.  In the query system, we used a
different strategy to avoid name conflicts in applying rules.
Each time we apply a rule we rename the variables with new names
that are guaranteed to be unique.  The analogous strategy for the
Lisp evaluator would be to do away with local environments and
simply rename the variables in the body of a procedure each time
we apply the procedure.
</p>

<p>
Implement for the query language a rule-application method that
uses environments rather than renaming.  See if you can build on
your environment structure to create constructs in the query
language for dealing with large systems, such as the rule analog
of block-structured procedures.  Can you relate any of this to the
problem of making deductions in a context (e.g., "If I supposed
that P were true, then I would be able to deduce A and B.") as a
method of problem solving?  (This problem is open-ended.  A good
answer is probably worth a Ph.D.)

<p>
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple
ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas
into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.  2.
The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex,
together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of
them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all
its ideas of relations.  3.  The third is separating them from all
other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is
called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

&#x2013;John Locke, <span class="underline">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span> (1690)

<p>
We are about to study the idea of a "computational process".
Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.  As
they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called "data".
The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a "program".
People create programs to direct processes.  In effect, we conjure the
spirits of the computer with our spells.
</p>

<p>
A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a
spirit.  It cannot be seen or touched.  It is not composed of matter at
all.  However, it is very real.  It can perform intellectual work.  It
can answer questions.  It can affect the world by disbursing money at a
bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.  The programs we use
to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells.  They are carefully
composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric "programming
languages" that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.
</p>

<p>
A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes
programs precisely and accurately.  Thus, like the sorcerer's
apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to
anticipate the consequences of their conjuring.  Even small errors
(usually called "bugs" or "glitches") in programs can have complex and
unanticipated consequences.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than
learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently
contained in a secure way.  Real-world programming, however, requires
care, expertise, and wisdom.  A small bug in a computer-aided design
program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an
airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
</p>

<p>
Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so
that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will
perform the tasks intended.  They can visualize the behavior of their
systems in advance.  They know how to structure programs so that
unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and
when problems do arise, they can "debug" their programs.  Well-designed
computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear
reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be
constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.
</p>

<p>
Programming in Lisp
</p>
<hr />

<p>
We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will
use for this purpose the programming language Lisp.  Just as our
everyday thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such
as English, French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative
phenomena are expressed with mathematical notations, our procedural
thoughts will be expressed in Lisp.  Lisp was invented in the late
1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use of certain kinds of
logical expressions, called "recursion equations", as a model for
computation.  The language was conceived by John McCarthy and is based
on his paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their
Computation by Machine" (McCarthy 1960).
</p>

<p>
Despite its inception as a mathematical formalism, Lisp is a
practical programming language.  A Lisp "interpreter" is a machine that
carries out processes described in the Lisp language.  The first Lisp
interpreter was implemented by McCarthy with the help of colleagues and
students in the Artificial Intelligence Group of the MIT Research
Laboratory of Electronics and in the MIT Computation Center.(1)  Lisp,
whose name is an acronym for LISt Processing, was designed to provide
symbol-manipulating capabilities for attacking programming problems
such as the symbolic differentiation and integration of algebraic
expressions.  It included for this purpose new data objects known as
atoms and lists, which most strikingly set it apart from all other
languages of the period.
</p>

<p>
Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort.  Instead, it
evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users'
needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations.  Lisp's informal
evolution has continued through the years, and the community of Lisp
users has traditionally resisted attempts to promulgate any "official"
definition of the language.  This evolution, together with the
flexibility and elegance of the initial conception, has enabled Lisp,
which is the second oldest language in widespread use today (only
Fortran is older), to continually adapt to encompass the most modern
ideas about program design.  Thus, Lisp is by now a family of dialects,
which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one
another in significant ways.  The dialect of Lisp used in this book is
called Scheme.(2)
</p>

<p>
Because of its experimental character and its emphasis on symbol
manipulation, Lisp was at first very inefficient for numerical
computations, at least in comparison with Fortran.  Over the years,
however, Lisp compilers have been developed that translate programs
into machine code that can perform numerical computations reasonably
efficiently.  And for special applications, Lisp has been used with
great effectiveness.(3)  Although Lisp has not yet overcome its old
reputation as hopelessly inefficient, Lisp is now used in many
applications where efficiency is not the central concern.  For example,
Lisp has become a language of choice for operating-system shell
languages and for extension languages for editors and computer-aided
design systems.
</p>

<p>
If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the
framework for our discussion of programming?  Because the language
possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying
important programming constructs and data structures and for relating
them to the linguistic features that support them.  The most
significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of
processes, called "procedures", can themselves be represented and
manipulated as Lisp data.  The importance of this is that there are
powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the
traditional distinction between "passive" data and "active" processes.
As we shall discover, Lisp's flexibility in handling procedures as data
makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for
exploring these techniques.  The ability to represent procedures as
data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that
must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and
compilers that support computer languages.  Above and beyond these
considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

1.5 Programmer's Manual' (McCarthy 1965) was published in 1962.  The
early history of Lisp is described in McCarthy 1978.

<p>
(2) The two dialects in which most major Lisp programs of the 1970s
were written are MacLisp (Moon 1978; Pitman 1983), developed at the MIT
Project MAC, and Interlisp (Teitelman 1974), developed at Bolt Beranek
and Newman Inc. and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.  Portable
Standard Lisp (Hearn 1969; Griss 1981) was a Lisp dialect designed to
be easily portable between different machines.  MacLisp spawned a
number of subdialects, such as Franz Lisp, which was developed at the
University of California at Berkeley, and Zetalisp (Moon 1981), which
was based on a special-purpose processor designed at the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory to run Lisp very efficiently.  The Lisp dialect
used in this book, called Scheme (Steele 1975), was invented in 1975 by
Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman of the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory and later reimplemented for instructional use
at MIT.  Scheme became an IEEE standard in 1990 (IEEE 1990).  The
Common Lisp dialect (Steele 1982, Steele 1990) was developed by the
Lisp community to combine features from the earlier Lisp dialects to
make an industrial standard for Lisp.  Common Lisp became an ANSI
standard in 1994 (ANSI 1994).

scientific importance&#x2013;an integration of the motion of the Solar System
that extended previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude, and
demonstrated that the dynamics of the Solar System is chaotic.  This
computation was made possible by new integration algorithms, a
special-purpose compiler, and a special-purpose computer all
implemented with the aid of software tools written in Lisp (Abelson et
al. 1992; Sussman and Wisdom 1992).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
A powerful programming language is more than just a means for
instructing a computer to perform tasks.  The language also serves as a
framework within which we organize our ideas about processes.  Thus,
when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the
means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form
more complex ideas.  Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
accomplishing this:
</p>

<p>
"primitive expressions"
which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned
with,
</p>

<p>
"means of combination"
by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
</p>

<p>
"means of abstraction"
by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
</p>


<p>
In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and
data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.)
Informally, data is "stuff" that we want to manipulate, and procedures
are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.  Thus, any
powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data
and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and
abstracting procedures and data.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that
we can focus on the rules for building procedures.(1) In later chapters
we will see that these same rules allow us to build procedures to
manipulate compound data as well.
</p>

<p>
(1) The characterization of numbers as "simple data" is a barefaced
bluff.  In fact, the treatment of numbers is one of the trickiest and
most confusing aspects of any programming language.  Some typical
issues involved are these: Some computer systems distinguish "integers",
such as 2, from "real numbers", such as 2.71.  Is the real number 2.00
different from the integer 2?  Are the arithmetic operations used for
integers the same as the operations used for real numbers?  Does 6
divided by 2 produce 3, or 3.0?  How large a number can we represent?
How many decimal places of accuracy can we represent?  Is the range of
integers the same as the range of real numbers?  Above and beyond these
questions, of course, lies a collection of issues concerning roundoff
and truncation errors - the entire science of numerical analysis.
Since our focus in this book is on large-scale program design rather
than on numerical techniques, we are going to ignore these problems.
The numerical examples in this chapter will exhibit the usual roundoff
behavior that one observes when using arithmetic operations that
preserve a limited number of decimal places of accuracy in noninteger
operations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<hr />

<p>
One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical
interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp.
Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal.  You type an "expression",
and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its "evaluating"
that expression.
</p>

<p>
One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number.  (More
precisely, the expression that you type consists of the numerals that
represent the number in base 10.)  If you present Lisp with a number
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org8564367">
486
</pre>

<p>
the interpreter will respond by printing (1)
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org55a36c5">
486
</pre>

<p>
Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression
representing a primitive procedure (such as `+' or `*') to form a
compound expression that represents the application of the procedure to
those numbers.  For example:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge359ecd">
(+ 137 349)
486

(- 1000 334)
666

(* 5 99)
495

(/ 10 5)
2

(+ 2.7 10)
12.7
</pre>

<p>
Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of
expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure
application, are called "combinations".  The leftmost element in the
list is called the "operator", and the other elements are called "operands".
The value of a combination is obtained by applying the procedure
specified by the operator to the "arguments" that are the values of the
operands.
</p>

<p>
The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands
is known as "prefix notation", and it may be somewhat confusing at
first because it departs significantly from the customary mathematical
convention.  Prefix notation has several advantages, however.  One of
them is that it can accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary
number of arguments, as in the following examples:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org3879af4">
(+ 21 35 12 7)
75

(* 25 4 12)
1200
</pre>

<p>
No ambiguity can arise, because the operator is always the leftmost
element and the entire combination is delimited by the parentheses.
</p>

<p>
A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends in a
straightforward way to allow combinations to be nested, that is, to
have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org14b1f69">
(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
19
</pre>

<p>
There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to
the overall complexity of the expressions that the Lisp interpreter can
evaluate.  It is we humans who get confused by still relatively simple
expressions such as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5757f75">
(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))
</pre>

<p>
which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57.  We can help
ourselves by writing such an expression in the form
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org6738baf">
(+ (* 3
      (+ (* 2 4)
         (+ 3 5)))
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6))
</pre>

<p>
following a formatting convention known as "pretty-printing", in which
each long combination is written so that the operands are aligned
vertically.  The resulting indentations display clearly the structure
of the expression.(2)
</p>

<p>
Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in
the same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal,
evaluates the expression, and prints the result.  This mode of
operation is often expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a "read-eval-print
loop".  Observe in particular that it is not necessary to explicitly
instruct the interpreter to print the value of the expression.(3)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) Throughout this book, when we wish to emphasize the distinction
between the input typed by the user and the response printed by the
interpreter, we will show the latter in slanted characters.
</p>

<p>
(2) Lisp systems typically provide features to aid the user in
formatting expressions.  Two especially useful features are one that
automatically indents to the proper pretty-print position whenever a
new line is started and one that highlights the matching left
parenthesis whenever a right parenthesis is typed.
</p>

<p>
(3) Lisp obeys the convention that every expression has a value.
This convention, together with the old reputation of Lisp as an
inefficient language, is the source of the quip by Alan Perlis
(paraphrasing Oscar Wilde) that "Lisp programmers know the value of
everything but the cost of nothing."

<h3 id="org70e5c5b"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Naming and the Environment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<hr />

<p>
A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides
for using names to refer to computational objects.  We say that the
name identifies a "variable" whose "value" is the object.
</p>

<p>
In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with `define'.  Typing
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">size</span> 2)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
causes the interpreter to associate the value 2 with the name
`size'.(1) Once the name `size' has been associated with the number 2,
we can refer to the value 2 by name:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7baab1b">
size
2

(* 5 size)
10
</pre>

<p>
Here are further examples of the use of `define':
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgab36731">
(define pi 3.14159)

(define radius 10)

(* pi (* radius radius))
314.159

(define circumference (* 2 pi radius))

circumference
62.8318
</pre>

<p>
`Define' is our language's simplest means of abstraction, for it
allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound
operations, such as the `circumference' computed above.  In general,
computational objects may have very complex structures, and it would be
extremely inconvenient to have to remember and repeat their details
each time we want to use them.  Indeed, complex programs are
constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of
increasing complexity. The interpreter makes this step-by-step program
construction particularly convenient because name-object associations
can be created incrementally in successive interactions.  This feature
encourages the incremental development and testing of programs and is
largely responsible for the fact that a Lisp program usually consists
of a large number of relatively simple procedures.
</p>

<p>
It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with
symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must
maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs.
This memory is called the "environment" (more precisely the "global
environment", since we will see later that a computation may involve a
number of different environments).(2)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) In this book, we do not show the interpreter's response to
evaluating definitions, since this is highly implementation-dependent.
</p>

<p>
(2) *Note Chapter 3:: will show that this notion of environment is
crucial, both for understanding how the interpreter works and for
implementing interpreters.

<div id="outline-container-org682f318" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org682f318"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Evaluating Combinations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<hr />

<p>
One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking
procedurally.  As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating
combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.
</p>

<p>
To evaluate a combination, do the following:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.</li>

<li>Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost
subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the
values of the other subexpressions (the operands).</li>
</ol>


<p>
Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about
processes in general.  First, observe that the first step dictates that
in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must
first perform the evaluation process on each element of the
combination.  Thus, the evaluation rule is "recursive" in nature; that
is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule
itself.(1)
</p>

<p>
Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express
what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be
viewed as a rather complicated process.  For example, evaluating
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7caee76">
(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7))
</pre>

<p>
requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different
combinations.  We can obtain a picture of this process by representing
the combination in the form of a tree, as shown in *Note Figure 1-1::.
Each combination is represented by a node with branches corresponding
to the operator and the operands of the combination stemming from it.
The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no branches stemming from them)
represent either operators or numbers.  Viewing evaluation in terms of
the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands percolate
upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher
and higher levels.  In general, we shall see that recursion is a very
powerful technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects.  In
fact, the "percolate values upward" form of the evaluation rule is an
example of a general kind of process known as "tree accumulation".
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 1.1:</b> Tree representation, showing the value of each subcombination.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7365d52">
  390
  /|\____________
 / |             \
*  26            15
   /|\            |
  / | \         // \\
 +  2  24      / |  | \
       /|\    +  3  5  7
      / | \
     *  4  6
</pre>

<p>
Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings
us to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but
primitive expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other
names.  We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,</li>

<li>the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction
sequences that carry out the corresponding operations, and</li>

<li>the values of other names are the objects associated with those
names in the environment.</li>
</ul>


<p>
We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by
stipulating that symbols such as `+' and `*' are also included in the
global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine
instructions that are their "values."  The key point to notice is the
role of the environment in determining the meaning of the symbols in
expressions.  In an interactive language such as Lisp, it is
meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as `(+ x 1)'
without specifying any information about the environment that would
provide a meaning for the symbol `x' (or even for the symbol `+').  As
we shall see in *Note Chapter 3::, the general notion of the
environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will
play an important role in our understanding of program execution.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle
definitions.  For instance, evaluating `(define x 3)' does not apply
`define' to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol `x'
and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the `define' is
precisely to associate `x' with a value.  (That is, `(define x 3)' is
not a combination.)
</p>

<p>
Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called forms
"special forms".  `Define' is the only example of a special form that
we have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly.  Each special
form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions
(each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the
programming language.  In comparison with most other programming
languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that is, the evaluation rule
for expressions can be described by a simple general rule together with
specialized rules for a small number of special forms.(2)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) It may seem strange that the evaluation rule says, as part of
the first step, that we should evaluate the leftmost element of a
combination, since at this point that can only be an operator such as
`+' or `*' representing a built-in primitive procedure such as addition
or multiplication.  We will see later that it is useful to be able to
work with combinations whose operators are themselves compound
expressions.
</p>

<p>
(2) Special syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative
surface structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways
are sometimes called "syntactic sugar", to use a phrase coined by Peter
Landin.  In comparison with users of other languages, Lisp programmers,
as a rule, are less concerned with matters of syntax.  (By contrast,
examine any Pascal manual and notice how much of it is devoted to
descriptions of syntax.)  This disdain for syntax is due partly to the
flexibility of Lisp, which makes it easy to change surface syntax, and
partly to the observation that many "convenient" syntactic constructs,
which make the language less uniform, end up causing more trouble than
they are worth when programs become large and complex.  In the words of
Alan Perlis, "Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon."

<h3 id="org8635b33"><span class="section-number-3">1.4.</span> Compound Procedures</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<hr />

<p>
We have identified in Lisp some of the elements that must appear in any
powerful programming language:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and
procedures.</li>

<li>Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.</li>

<li>Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited
means of abstraction.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Now we will learn about "procedure definitions", a much more powerful
abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name
and then referred to as a unit.
</p>

<p>
We begin by examining how to express the idea of "squaring."  We
might say, "To square something, multiply it by itself."  This is
expressed in our language as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">square</span> x) (* x x))
</pre>
</div>


<p>
We can understand this in the following way:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org72b993b">
(define (square    x)         (*      x         x))
  |        |       |           |      |         |
 To     square  something,  multiply  it  by  itself.
</pre>

<p>
We have here a "compound procedure", which has been given the name
`square'.  The procedure represents the operation of multiplying
something by itself.  The thing to be multiplied is given a local name,
`x', which plays the same role that a pronoun plays in natural
language.  Evaluating the definition creates this compound procedure
and associates it with the name `square'.(1)
</p>

<p>
The general form of a procedure definition is
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgbe62eb6">
(define (&lt;NAME&gt; &lt;FORMAL PARAMETERS&gt;) &lt;BODY&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
The &lt;NAME&gt; is a symbol to be associated with the procedure
definition in the environment.(2) The &lt;FORMAL PARAMETERS&gt; are the names
used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding
arguments of the procedure.  The &lt;BODY&gt; is an expression that will
yield the value of the procedure application when the formal parameters
are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is
applied.(3)  The &lt;NAME&gt; and the &lt;FORMAL PARAMETERS&gt; are grouped within
parentheses, just as they would be in an actual call to the procedure
being defined.
</p>

<p>
Having defined `square', we can now use it:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1773f65">
(square 21)
441

(square (+ 2 5))
49

(square (square 3))
81
</pre>

<p>
We can also use `square' as a building block in defining other
procedures.  For example, <code>x^2 + y^2</code> can be expressed as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2614b9a">
(+ (square x) (square y))
</pre>


<p>
We can easily define a procedure `sum-of-squares' that, given any two
numbers as arguments, produces the sum of their squares:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge123f46">
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
(sum-of-squares 3 4)
25
</pre>

<p>
Now we can use `sum-of-squares' as a building block in constructing
further procedures:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge8e6f9b">
(define (f a)
  (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))

(f 5)
136
</pre>

<p>
Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as primitive
procedures.  Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the definition of
`sum-of-squares' given above whether `square' was built into the
interpreter, like `+' and `*', or defined as a compound procedure.
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) Observe that there are two different operations being combined
here: we are creating the procedure, and we are giving it the name
`square'.  It is possible, indeed important, to be able to separate
these two notions&#x2013;to create procedures without naming them, and to
give names to procedures that have already been created.  We will see
how to do this in section *Note 1-3-2::.
</p>

<p>
(2) Throughout this book, we will describe the general syntax of
expressions by using italic symbols delimited by angle brackets&#x2013;e.g.,
&lt;NAME&gt;&#x2013;to denote the "slots" in the expression to be filled in when
such an expression is actually used.
</p>

<p>
(3) More generally, the body of the procedure can be a sequence of
expressions.  In this case, the interpreter evaluates each expression
in the sequence in turn and returns the value of the final expression
as the value of the procedure application.

<h3 id="orgd11e4a0"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> The Substitution Model for Procedure Application</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<hr />

<p>
To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound procedure, the
interpreter follows much the same process as for combinations whose
operators name primitive procedures, which we described in section
*Note 1-1-3::.  That is, the interpreter evaluates the elements of the
combination and applies the procedure (which is the value of the
operator of the combination) to the arguments (which are the values of
the operands of the combination).
</p>

<p>
We can assume that the mechanism for applying primitive procedures
to arguments is built into the interpreter.  For compound procedures,
the application process is as follows:
</p>

<p>
To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of
the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the
corresponding argument.
</p>

<p>
To illustrate this process, let's evaluate the combination
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgb1192a6">
(f 5)
</pre>

<p>
where `f' is the procedure defined in section *Note 1-1-4::.  We begin
by retrieving the body of `f':
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgaab8435">
(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))
</pre>

<p>
Then we replace the formal parameter `a' by the argument 5:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9bc16cc">
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))
</pre>

<p>
Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of a combination with two
operands and an operator `sum-of-squares'.  Evaluating this combination
involves three subproblems.  We must evaluate the operator to get the
procedure to be applied, and we must evaluate the operands to get the
arguments.  Now `(+ 5 1)' produces 6 and `(* 5 2)' produces 10, so we
must apply the `sum-of-squares' procedure to 6 and 10.  These values
are substituted for the formal parameters `x' and `y' in the body of
`sum-of-squares', reducing the expression to
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf7eb7ef">
(+ (square 6) (square 10))
</pre>

<p>
If we use the definition of `square', this reduces to
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgdb0d110">
(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))
</pre>

<p>
which reduces by multiplication to
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7c365c0">
(+ 36 100)
</pre>

<p>
and finally to
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgb127b9f">
136
</pre>

<p>
The process we have just described is called the "substitution model"
for procedure application.  It can be taken as a model that determines
the "meaning" of procedure application, insofar as the procedures in
this chapter are concerned.  However, there are two points that should
be stressed:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure
application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter
really works.  Typical interpreters do not evaluate procedure
applications by manipulating the text of a procedure to substitute
values for the formal parameters.  In practice, the "substitution"
is accomplished by using a local environment for the formal
parameters.  We will discuss this more fully in *Note Chapter 3::
and *Note Chapter 4:: when we examine the implementation of an
interpreter in detail.</li>

<li>Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of
increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work,
culminating with a complete implementation of an interpreter and
compiler in *Note Chapter 5::.  The substitution model is only the
first of these models&#x2013;a way to get started thinking formally
about the evaluation process.  In general, when modeling phenomena
in science and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete
models.  As we examine things in greater detail, these simple
models become inadequate and must be replaced by more refined
models.  The substitution model is no exception.  In particular,
when we address in *Note Chapter 3:: the use of procedures with
"mutable data," we will see that the substitution model breaks
down and must be replaced by a more complicated model of procedure
application.(1)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Applicative order versus normal order
</p>
<hr />

<p>
According to the description of evaluation given in section *Note
1-1-3::, the interpreter first evaluates the operator and operands and
then applies the resulting procedure to the resulting arguments.  This
is not the only way to perform evaluation.  An alternative evaluation
model would not evaluate the operands until their values were needed.
Instead it would first substitute operand expressions for parameters
until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and
would then perform the evaluation.  If we used this method, the
evaluation of `(f 5)' would proceed according to the sequence of
expansions
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org921c799">
(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))

(+    (square (+ 5 1))      (square (* 5 2))  )

(+    (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1))   (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))
</pre>

<p>
followed by the reductions
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org791588c">
(+         (* 6 6)             (* 10 10))

(+           36                   100)

                    136
</pre>

<p>
This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the
process is different.  In particular, the evaluations of `(+ 5 1)' and
`(* 5 2)' are each performed twice here, corresponding to the reduction
of the expression `(* x x)' with `x' replaced respectively by `(+ 5 1)'
and `(* 5 2)'.
</p>

<p>
This alternative "fully expand and then reduce" evaluation method is
known as "normal-order evaluation", in contrast to the "evaluate the
arguments and then apply" method that the interpreter actually uses,
which is called "applicative-order evaluation".  It can be shown that,
for procedure applications that can be modeled using substitution
(including all the procedures in the first two chapters of this book)
and that yield legitimate values, normal-order and applicative-order
evaluation produce the same value.  (See *Note Exercise 1-5:: for an
instance of an "illegitimate" value where normal-order and
applicative-order evaluation do not give the same result.)
</p>

<p>
Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the
additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations of
expressions such as those illustrated with `(+ 5 1)' and `(* 5 2)'
above and, more significantly, because normal-order evaluation becomes
much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of
procedures that can be modeled by substitution.  On the other hand,
normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable tool, and we will
investigate some of its implications in *Note Chapter 3:: and *Note
Chapter 4::.(2)
</p>

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) Despite the simplicity of the substitution idea, it turns out to
be surprisingly complicated to give a rigorous mathematical definition
of the substitution process.  The problem arises from the possibility of
confusion between the names used for the formal parameters of a
procedure and the (possibly identical) names used in the expressions to
which the procedure may be applied.  Indeed, there is a long history of
erroneous definitions of "substitution" in the literature of logic and
programming semantics.  See Stoy 1977 for a careful discussion of
substitution.
</p>

<p>
(2) In *Note Chapter 3:: we will introduce "stream processing",
which is a way of handling apparently "infinite" data structures by
incorporating a limited form of normal-order evaluation.  In section
*Note 4-2:: we will modify the Scheme interpreter to produce a
normal-order variant of Scheme.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<hr />

<p>
The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at
this point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to
perform different operations depending on the result of a test.  For
instance, we cannot define a procedure that computes the absolute value
of a number by testing whether the number is positive, negative, or
zero and taking different actions in the different cases according to
the rule
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9ebfa74">
      /
      |   x  if x &gt; 0
|x| = &lt;   0  if x = 0
      |  -x  if x &lt; 0
      \
</pre>

<p>
This construct is called a "case analysis", and there is a special
form in Lisp for notating such a case analysis.  It is called `cond'
(which stands for "conditional"), and it is used as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">abs</span> x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((&gt; x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((&lt; x 0) (- x))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The general form of a conditional expression is
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org6b559fe">
(cond (&lt;P1&gt; &lt;E1&gt;)
      (&lt;P2&gt; &lt;E2&gt;)
      ...
      (&lt;PN&gt; &lt;EN&gt;))
</pre>

<p>
consisting of the symbol `cond' followed by parenthesized pairs of
expressions
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org676941d">
(&lt;P&gt; &lt;E&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
called "clauses". The first expression in each pair is a "predicate"&#x2013;that
is, an expression whose value is interpreted as either true or false.(1)
</p>

<p>
Conditional expressions are evaluated as follows.  The predicate
&lt;P1&gt; is evaluated first.  If its value is false, then &lt;P2&gt; is
evaluated.  If &lt;P2&gt;'s value is also false, then &lt;P3&gt; is evaluated.
This process continues until a predicate is found whose value is true,
in which case the interpreter returns the value of the corresponding expression
"consequent expression" &lt;E&gt; of the clause as the value of the
conditional expression.  If none of the &lt;P&gt;'s is found to be true, the
value of the `cond' is undefined.
</p>

<p>
The word "predicate" is used for procedures that return true or
false, as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or false.  The
absolute-value procedure `abs' makes use of the primitive predicates
`&gt;', `&lt;', and `='.(2) These take two numbers as arguments and test
whether the first number is, respectively, greater than, less than, or
equal to the second number, returning true or false accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Another way to write the absolute-value procedure is
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">abs</span> x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((&lt; x 0) (- x))
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> x)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
which could be expressed in English as "If x is less than zero return -
x; otherwise return x."  `Else' is a special symbol that can be used in
place of the &lt;P&gt; in the final clause of a `cond'.  This causes the
`cond' to return as its value the value of the corresponding &lt;E&gt;
whenever all previous clauses have been bypassed.  In fact, any
expression that always evaluates to a true value could be used as the
&lt;P&gt; here.
</p>

<p>
Here is yet another way to write the absolute-value procedure:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">abs</span> x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&lt; x 0)
      (- x)
      x))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This uses the special form `if', a restricted type of conditional
that can be used when there are precisely two cases in the case
analysis.  The general form of an `if' expression is
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd2c763f">
(if &lt;PREDICATE&gt; &lt;CONSEQUENT&gt; &lt;ALTERNATIVE&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
To evaluate an `if' expression, the interpreter starts by evaluating
the &lt;PREDICATE&gt; part of the expression.  If the &lt;PREDICATE&gt; evaluates
to a true value, the interpreter then evaluates the &lt;CONSEQUENT&gt; and
returns its value.  Otherwise it evaluates the &lt;ALTERNATIVE&gt; and returns
its value.(3)
</p>

<p>
In addition to primitive predicates such as `&lt;', `=', and `&gt;', there
are logical composition operations, which enable us to construct
compound predicates.  The three most frequently used are these:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
`(and &lt;E1&gt; &#x2026; &lt;EN&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;E&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order.  If any &lt;E&gt; evaluates to false, the value of
the `and' expression is false, and the rest of the &lt;E&gt;'s are not
evaluated.  If all &lt;E&gt;'s evaluate to true values, the value of the
`and' expression is the value of the last one.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(or &lt;E1&gt; &#x2026; &lt;EN&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;E&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order.  If any &lt;E&gt; evaluates to a true value, that
value is returned as the value of the `or' expression, and the
rest of the &lt;E&gt;'s are not evaluated.  If all &lt;E&gt;'s evaluate to
false, the value of the `or' expression is false.
</p></li>

<li><p>
`(not &lt;E&gt;)'
</p>

<p>
The value of a `not' expression is true when the expression &lt;E&gt;
evaluates to false, and false otherwise.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
Notice that `and' and `or' are special forms, not procedures, because
the subexpressions are not necessarily all evaluated.  `Not' is an
ordinary procedure.
</p>

<p>
As an example of how these are used, the condition that a number x
be in the range 5 &lt; x &lt; 10 may be expressed as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org03fbd48">
(and (&gt; x 5) (&lt; x 10))
</pre>

<p>
As another example, we can define a predicate to test whether one
number is greater than or equal to another as
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgb449339">
(define (&gt;= x y)
  (or (&gt; x y) (= x y)))
</pre>

<p>
or alternatively as
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org1b3aafa">
(define (&gt;= x y)
  (not (&lt; x y)))
</pre>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.1:</b> Below is a sequence of expressions.  What is the

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses
applicative-order evaluation?  What behavior will he observe with
an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation?  Explain your
answer.  (Assume that the evaluation rule for the special form
`if' is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first,
and the result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or
the alternative expression.)

<p>
-----&#x2013;&#x2014; Footnotes -----&#x2013;&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
(1) "Interpreted as either true or false" means this: In Scheme,
there are two distinguished values that are denoted by the constants
`#t' and `#f'.  When the interpreter checks a predicate's value, it
interprets `#f' as false.  Any other value is treated as true.  (Thus,
providing `#t' is logically unnecessary, but it is convenient.)  In
this book we will use names `true' and `false', which are associated
with the values `#t' and `#f' respectively.
</p>

<p>
(2) `Abs' also uses the "minus" operator `-', which, when used with
a single operand, as in `(- x)', indicates negation.
</p>

<p>
(3) A minor difference between `if' and `cond' is that the &lt;E&gt; part
of each `cond' clause may be a sequence of expressions.  If the
corresponding &lt;P&gt; is found to be true, the expressions &lt;E&gt; are
evaluated in sequence and the value of the final expression in the
sequence is returned as the value of the `cond'.  In an `if'
expression, however, the &lt;CONSEQUENT&gt; and &lt;ALTERNATIVE&gt; must be single
expressions.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<hr />

<p>
Procedures, as introduced above, are much like ordinary mathematical
functions.  They specify a value that is determined by one or more
parameters.  But there is an important difference between mathematical
functions and computer procedures.  Procedures must be effective.
</p>

<p>
   As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square roots.
We can define the square-root function as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8c594de">
sqrt(x) = the y such that y &gt;= 0 and y^2 = x
</pre>

<p>
This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function.  We
could use it to recognize whether one number is the square root of
another, or to derive facts about square roots in general.  On the
other hand, the definition does not describe a procedure.  Indeed, it
tells us almost nothing about how to actually find the square root of a
given number.  It will not help matters to rephrase this definition in
pseudo-Lisp:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgaccb750">
(define (sqrt x)
  (the y (and (&gt;= y 0)
              (= (square y) x))))
</pre>

<p>
This only begs the question.
</p>

<p>
The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the
general distinction between describing properties of things and
describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the
distinction between declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge.  In
mathematics we are usually concerned with declarative (what is)
descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with
imperative (how to) descriptions.(1)
</p>

<p>
How does one compute square roots?  The most common way is to use
Newton's method of successive approximations, which says that whenever
we have a guess y for the value of the square root of a number x, we
can perform a simple manipulation to get a better guess (one closer to
the actual square root) by averaging y with x/y.(2) For example, we can
compute the square root of 2 as follows.  Suppose our initial guess is
1:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org58f5331">
Guess  Quotient             Average
1      (2/1) = 2            ((2 + 1)/2) = 1.5
1.5    (2/1.5) = 1.3333     ((1.3333 + 1.5)/2) = 1.4167
1.4167 (2/1.4167) = 1.4118  ((1.4167 + 1.4118)/2) = 1.4142
1.4142 ...                  ...
</pre>

<p>
Continuing this process, we obtain better and better approximations to
the square root.
</p>

<p>
Now let's formalize the process in terms of procedures.  We start
with a value for the radicand (the number whose square root we are
trying to compute) and a value for the guess.  If the guess is good
enough for our purposes, we are done; if not, we must repeat the
process with an improved guess.  We write this basic strategy as a
procedure:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt-iter</span> guess x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                 x)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A guess is improved by averaging it with the quotient of the
radicand and the old guess:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">improve</span> guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
where
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">average</span> x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We also have to say what we mean by "good enough."  The following
will do for illustration, but it is not really a very good test.  (See
exercise *Note Exercise 1-7::.)  The idea is to improve the answer
until it is close enough so that its square differs from the radicand
by less than a predetermined tolerance (here 0.001):(3)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">good-enough?</span> guess x)
  (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, we need a way to get started.  For instance, we can always
guess that the square root of any number is 1:(4)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If we type these definitions to the interpreter, we can use `sqrt'
just as we can use any procedure:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org982884c">
(sqrt 9)
3.00009155413138

(sqrt (+ 100 37))
11.704699917758145

(sqrt (+ (sqrt 2) (sqrt 3)))
1.7739279023207892

(square (sqrt 1000))
1000.000369924366
</pre>

<p>
The `sqrt' program also illustrates that the simple procedural
language we have introduced so far is sufficient for writing any purely
numerical program that one could write in, say, C or Pascal.  This
might seem surprising, since we have not included in our language any
iterative (looping) constructs that direct the computer to do something
over and over again.  `Sqrt-iter', on the other hand, demonstrates how
iteration can be accomplished using no special construct other than the
ordinary ability to call a procedure.(5)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.6:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why `if' needs to be
provided as a special form.  "Why can't I just define it as an
ordinary procedure in terms of `cond'?" she asks.  Alyssa's friend
Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new
version of `if':
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org74d68f9">
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
</pre>

<p>
Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org1d9fbef">
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5

(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
</pre>

<p>
Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if' to rewrite the square-root program:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org42ff8e1">
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
</pre>

<p>
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square
roots?  Explain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.7:</b> The `good-enough?' test used in computing square
roots will not be very effective for finding the square roots of
very small numbers.  Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations
are almost always performed with limited precision.  This makes
our test inadequate for very large numbers.  Explain these
statements, with examples showing how the test fails for small and
large numbers.  An alternative strategy for implementing
`good-enough?' is to watch how `guess' changes from one iteration
to the next and to stop when the change is a very small fraction
of the guess.  Design a square-root procedure that uses this kind
of end test.  Does this work better for small and large numbers?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.8:</b> Newton's method for cube roots is based on the
fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a
better approximation is given by the value
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8c10e95">
x/y^2 + 2y
----------
    3
</pre>

<p>
Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to
the square-root procedure.  (In section *Note 1-3-4:: we will see
how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of
these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

<p>
(1) Declarative and imperative descriptions are intimately related,
as indeed are mathematics and computer science.  For instance, to say
that the answer produced by a program is "correct" is to make a
declarative statement about the program.  There is a large amount of
research aimed at establishing techniques for proving that programs are
correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this subject has to do
with negotiating the transition between imperative statements (from
which programs are constructed) and declarative statements (which can be
used to deduce things).  In a related vein, an important current area in
programming-language design is the exploration of so-called very
high-level languages, in which one actually programs in terms of
declarative statements.  The idea is to make interpreters sophisticated
enough so that, given "what is" knowledge specified by the programmer,
they can generate "how to" knowledge automatically.  This cannot be
done in general, but there are important areas where progress has been
made.  We shall revisit this idea in *Note Chapter 4::.
</p>

<p>
(2) This square-root algorithm is actually a special case of
Newton's method, which is a general technique for finding roots of
equations.  The square-root algorithm itself was developed by Heron of
Alexandria in the first century A.D.  We will see how to express the
general Newton's method as a Lisp procedure in section *Note 1-3-4::.
</p>

<p>
(3) We will usually give predicates names ending with question
marks, to help us remember that they are predicates.  This is just a
stylistic convention.  As far as the interpreter is concerned, the
question mark is just an ordinary character.
</p>

<p>
(4) Observe that we express our initial guess as 1.0 rather than 1.
This would not make any difference in many Lisp implementations.  MIT
Scheme, however, distinguishes between exact integers and decimal
values, and dividing two integers produces a rational number rather
than a decimal.  For example, dividing 10 by 6 yields 5/3, while
dividing 10.0 by 6.0 yields 1.6666666666666667.  (We will learn how to
implement arithmetic on rational numbers in section *Note 2-1-1::.)  If
we start with an initial guess of 1 in our square-root program, and x
is an exact integer, all subsequent values produced in the square-root
computation will be rational numbers rather than decimals.  Mixed
operations on rational numbers and decimals always yield decimals, so
starting with an initial guess of 1.0 forces all subsequent values to
be decimals.
</p>

<p>
(5) Readers who are worried about the efficiency issues involved in
using procedure calls to implement iteration should note the remarks on
"tail recursion" in section *Note 1-2-1::.

<p>
`Sqrt' is our first example of a process defined by a set of mutually
defined procedures.  Notice that the definition of `sqrt-iter' is "recursive";
that is, the procedure is defined in terms of itself.  The idea of
being able to define a procedure in terms of itself may be disturbing;
it may seem unclear how such a "circular" definition could make sense
at all, much less specify a well-defined process to be carried out by a
computer.  This will be addressed more carefully in section *Note
1-2::.  But first let's consider some other important points
illustrated by the `sqrt' example.
</p>

<p>
Observe that the problem of computing square roots breaks up
naturally into a number of subproblems: how to tell whether a guess is
good enough, how to improve a guess, and so on.  Each of these tasks is
accomplished by a separate procedure.  The entire `sqrt' program can be
viewed as a cluster of procedures (shown in *Note Figure 1-2::) that
mirrors the decomposition of the problem into subproblems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Figure 1.2:</b> Procedural decomposition of the `sqrt' program.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgff1409f">
            sqrt
             |
         sqrt-iter
         /       \
 good-enough    improve
   /    \          |
square  abs     average
</pre>

<p>
The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply that one
is dividing the program into parts.  After all, we could take any large
program and divide it into parts&#x2013;the first ten lines, the next ten
lines, the next ten lines, and so on.  Rather, it is crucial that each
procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as a
module in defining other procedures.  For example, when we define the
`good-enough?' procedure in terms of `square', we are able to regard
the `square' procedure as a "black box."  We are not at that moment
concerned with <span class="underline">how</span> the procedure computes its result, only with the
fact that it computes the square.  The details of how the square is
computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a later time.  Indeed,
as far as the `good-enough?' procedure is concerned, `square' is not
quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a procedure, a so-called "procedural
abstraction".  At this level of abstraction, any procedure that
computes the square is equally good.
</p>

<p>
Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two
procedures for squaring a number should be indistinguishable.  Each
takes a numerical argument and produces the square of that number as
the value.(1)
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">square</span> x) (* x x))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">square</span> x)
  (exp (double (log x))))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">double</span> x) (+ x x))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So a procedure definition should be able to suppress detail.  The
users of the procedure may not have written the procedure themselves,
but may have obtained it from another programmer as a black box.  A
user should not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order
to use it.
</p>

<p>
Local names
</p>
<hr />

<p>
One detail of a procedure's implementation that should not matter to
the user of the procedure is the implementer's choice of names for the
procedure's formal parameters.  Thus, the following procedures should
not be distinguishable:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">square</span> x) (* x x))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">square</span> y) (* y y))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This principle&#x2013;that the meaning of a procedure should be
independent of the parameter names used by its author&#x2013;seems on the
surface to be self-evident, but its consequences are profound.  The
simplest consequence is that the parameter names of a procedure must be
local to the body of the procedure.  For example, we used `square' in
the definition of `good-enough?' in our square-root procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">good-enough?</span> guess x)
  (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The intention of the author of `good-enough?' is to determine if the
square of the first argument is within a given tolerance of the second
argument.  We see that the author of `good-enough?' used the name
`guess' to refer to the first argument and `x' to refer to the second
argument.  The argument of `square' is `guess'.  If the author of
`square' used `x' (as above) to refer to that argument, we see that the
`x' in `good-enough?' must be a different `x' than the one in `square'.
Running the procedure `square' must not affect the value of `x' that
is used by `good-enough?', because that value of `x' may be needed by
`good-enough?' after `square' is done computing.
</p>

<p>
If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective
procedures, then the parameter `x' in `square' could be confused with
the parameter `x' in `good-enough?', and the behavior of `good-enough?'
would depend upon which version of `square' we used.  Thus, `square'
would not be the black box we desired.
</p>

<p>
A formal parameter of a procedure has a very special role in the
procedure definition, in that it doesn't matter what name the formal
parameter has.  Such a name is called a "bound variable", and we say
that the procedure definition "binds" its formal parameters.  The
meaning of a procedure definition is unchanged if a bound variable is
consistently renamed throughout the definition.(2)  If a variable is
not bound, we say that it is "free".  The set of expressions for which
a binding defines a name is called the "scope" of that name.  In a
procedure definition, the bound variables declared as the formal
parameters of the procedure have the body of the procedure as their
scope.
</p>

<p>
In the definition of `good-enough?' above, `guess' and `x' are bound
variables but `&lt;', `-', `abs', and `square' are free.  The meaning of
`good-enough?' should be independent of the names we choose for `guess'
and `x' so long as they are distinct and different from `&lt;', `-',
`abs', and `square'.  (If we renamed `guess' to `abs' we would have
introduced a bug by "capturing" the variable `abs'.  It would have
changed from free to bound.)  The meaning of `good-enough?' is not
independent of the names of its free variables, however.  It surely
depends upon the fact (external to this definition) that the symbol
`abs' names a procedure for computing the absolute value of a number.
`Good-enough?' will compute a different function if we substitute `cos'
for `abs' in its definition.
</p>

<p>
Internal definitions and block structure
</p>
<hr />

<p>
We have one kind of name isolation available to us so far: The formal
parameters of a procedure are local to the body of the procedure.  The
square-root program illustrates another way in which we would like to
control the use of names.  The existing program consists of separate
procedures:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt-iter</span> guess x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">good-enough?</span> guess x)
  (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">improve</span> guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The problem with this program is that the only procedure that is
important to users of `sqrt' is `sqrt'.  The other procedures
(`sqrt-iter', `good-enough?', and `improve') only clutter up their
minds.  They may not define any other procedure called `good-enough?'
as part of another program to work together with the square-root
program, because `sqrt' needs it.  The problem is especially severe in
the construction of large systems by many separate programmers.  For
example, in the construction of a large library of numerical
procedures, many numerical functions are computed as successive
approximations and thus might have procedures named `good-enough?' and
`improve' as auxiliary procedures.  We would like to localize the
subprocedures, hiding them inside `sqrt' so that `sqrt' could coexist
with other successive approximations, each having its own private
`good-enough?' procedure.  To make this possible, we allow a procedure
to have internal definitions that are local to that procedure.  For
example, in the square-root problem we can write
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">good-enough?</span> guess x)
    (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">improve</span> guess x)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt-iter</span> guess x)
    (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (good-enough? guess x)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Such nesting of definitions, called "block structure", is basically
the right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem.  But there
is a better idea lurking here.  In addition to internalizing the
definitions of the auxiliary procedures, we can simplify them.  Since
`x' is bound in the definition of `sqrt', the procedures
`good-enough?', `improve', and `sqrt-iter', which are defined
internally to `sqrt', are in the scope of `x'.  Thus, it is not
necessary to pass `x' explicitly to each of these procedures.  Instead,
we allow `x' to be a free variable in the internal definitions, as
shown below. Then `x' gets its value from the argument with which the
enclosing procedure `sqrt' is called.  This discipline is called "lexical
scoping".(3)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">good-enough?</span> guess)
    (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">improve</span> guess)
    (average guess (/ x guess)))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt-iter</span> guess)
    (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (good-enough? guess)
        guess
        (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))
  (sqrt-iter 1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We will use block structure extensively to help us break up large
programs into tractable pieces.(4) The idea of block structure
originated with the programming language Algol 60. It appears in most
advanced programming languages and is an important tool for helping to
organize the construction of large programs.

(1) It is not even clear which of these procedures is a more
efficient implementation.  This depends upon the hardware available.
There are machines for which the "obvious" implementation is the less
efficient one.  Consider a machine that has extensive tables of
logarithms and antilogarithms stored in a very efficient manner.
</p>

<p>
(2) The concept of consistent renaming is actually subtle and
difficult to define formally.  Famous logicians have made embarrassing
errors here.
</p>

<p>
(3) [Footnote 28] Lexical scoping dictates that free variables in a
procedure are taken to refer to bindings made by enclosing procedure
definitions; that is, they are looked up in the environment in which the
procedure was defined. We will see how this works in detail in chapter
3 when we study environments and the detailed behavior of the
interpreter.
</p>

<p>
(4) Embedded definitions must come first in a procedure body. The
management is not responsible for the consequences of running programs
that intertwine definition and use.

We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used
primitive arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations, and
we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as
compound procedures.  But that is not enough to enable us to say that
we know how to program.  Our situation is analogous to that of someone
who has learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but knows
nothing of typical openings, tactics, or strategy.  Like the novice
chess player, we don't yet know the common patterns of usage in the
domain.  We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making (which
procedures are worth defining).  We lack the experience to predict the
consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).
</p>

<p>
   The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under
consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it
is in any synthetic, creative activity.  In becoming an expert
photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and
know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible
choice of exposure and development conditions.  Only then can one
reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and development
to obtain the desired effects.  So it is with programming, where we are
planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where we
control the process by means of a program.  To become experts, we must
learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of
procedures.  Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to
reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.
</p>

<p>
   A procedure is a pattern for the "local evolution" of a computational
process.  It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the
previous stage.  We would like to be able to make statements about the
overall, or "global", behavior of a process whose local evolution has
been specified by a procedure.  This is very difficult to do in
general, but we can at least try to describe some typical patterns of
process evolution.
</p>

   In this section we will examine some common "shapes" for processes
generated by simple procedures.  We will also investigate the rates at
which these processes consume the important computational resources of
time and space.  The procedures we will consider are very simple.
Their role is like that played by test patterns in photography: as
oversimplified prototypical patterns, rather than practical examples in
their own right.

</pre>

<p>
We begin by considering the factorial function, defined by
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org261eb2c">
n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) ... 3 * 2 * 1
</pre>

<p>
There are many ways to compute factorials.  One way is to make use
of the observation that n! is equal to n times (n - 1)! for any positive
integer n:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org780c452">
n! = n * [(n - 1) * (n - 2) ... 3 * 2 * 1] = n * (n - 1)!
</pre>

<p>
Thus, we can compute n! by computing (n - 1)! and multiplying the
result by n.  If we add the stipulation that 1! is equal to 1, this
observation translates directly into a procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">factorial</span> n)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can use the substitution model of section *Note 1-1-5:: to watch
this procedure in action computing 6!, as shown in *Note Figure 1-3::.
</p>

<p>
Now let's take a different perspective on computing factorials.  We
could describe a rule for computing n! by specifying that we first
multiply 1 by 2, then multiply the result by 3, then by 4, and so on
until we reach n.  More formally, we maintain a running product,
together with a counter that counts from 1 up to n.  We can describe
the computation by saying that the counter and the product
simultaneously change from one step to the next according to the rule
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org46bc5b8">
product  &lt;-  counter  ...  product

counter  &lt;-  counter  +  1
</pre>

<p>
and stipulating that n! is the value of the product when the counter
exceeds n.
</p>

<p>
Once again, we can recast our description as a procedure for
computing factorials:(1)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">factorial</span> n)
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))

  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&gt; counter max-count)
      product
      (fact-iter (* counter product)
                 (+ counter 1)
                 max-count)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As before, we can use the substitution model to visualize the
process of computing 6!, as shown in *Note Figure 1-4::.
</p>

<p>
Compare the two processes.  From one point of view, they seem hardly
different at all.  Both compute the same mathematical function on the
same domain, and each requires a number of steps proportional to n to
compute n!.  Indeed, both processes even carry out the same sequence of
multiplications, obtaining the same sequence of partial products.  On
the other hand, when we consider the "shapes" of the two processes, we
find that they evolve quite differently.
</p>

<p>
Consider the first process.  The substitution model reveals a shape
of expansion followed by contraction, indicated by the arrow in *Note
Figure 1-3::.  The expansion occurs as the process builds up a chain of operations
"deferred operations" (in this case, a chain of multiplications).  The
contraction occurs as the operations are actually performed.  This type
of process, characterized by a chain of deferred operations, is called
a "recursive process".  Carrying out this process requires that the
interpreter keep track of the operations to be performed later on.  In
the computation of n!, the length of the chain of deferred
multiplications, and hence the amount of information needed to keep
track of it, grows linearly with n (is proportional to n), just like
the number of steps.  Such a process is called a "linear recursive
process".
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the second process does not grow and shrink.  At each
step, all we need to keep track of, for any n, are the current values
of the variables `product', `counter', and `max-count'.  We call this an "iterative
process".  In general, an iterative process is one whose state can be
summarized by a fixed number of "state variables", together with a
fixed rule that describes how the state variables should be updated as
the process moves from state to state and an (optional) end test that
specifies conditions under which the process should terminate.  In
computing n!, the number of steps required grows linearly with n.  Such
a process is called a "linear iterative process".
</p>

<p>
The contrast between the two processes can be seen in another way.
In the iterative case, the program variables provide a complete
description of the state of the process at any point.  If we stopped
the computation between steps, all we would need to do to resume the
computation is to supply the interpreter with the values of the three
program variables.  Not so with the recursive process.  In this case
there is some additional "hidden" information, maintained by the
interpreter and not contained in the program variables, which indicates
"where the process is" in negotiating the chain of deferred operations.
The longer the chain, the more information must be maintained.(2)
</p>

<p>
In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to
confuse the notion of a recursive "process" with the notion of a
recursive "procedure".  When we describe a procedure as recursive, we
are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition
refers (either directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself.  But
when we describe a process as following a pattern that is, say,
linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not
about the syntax of how a procedure is written.  It may seem disturbing
that we refer to a recursive procedure such as `fact-iter' as
generating an iterative process.  However, the process really is
iterative: Its state is captured completely by its three state
variables, and an interpreter need keep track of only three variables
in order to execute the process.
</p>

<p>
One reason that the distinction between process and procedure may be
confusing is that most implementations of common languages (including
Ada, Pascal, and C) are designed in such a way that the interpretation
of any recursive procedure consumes an amount of memory that grows with
the number of procedure calls, even when the process described is, in
principle, iterative.  As a consequence, these languages can describe
iterative processes only by resorting to special-purpose "looping
constructs" such as `do', `repeat', `until', `for', and `while'.  The
implementation of Scheme we shall consider in *Note Chapter 5:: does
not share this defect.  It will execute an iterative process in
constant space, even if the iterative process is described by a
recursive procedure.  An implementation with this property is called "tail-recursive".
With a tail-recursive implementation, iteration can be expressed using
the ordinary procedure call mechanism, so that special iteration
constructs are useful only as syntactic sugar.(3)

<p>
(1) In a real program we would probably use the block structure
introduced in the last section to hide the definition of `fact-iter':

                          (+ counter 1))))
        (iter 1 1))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We avoided doing this here so as to minimize the number of things to
think about at once.
</p>

<p>
(2) When we discuss the implementation of procedures on register
machines in *Note Chapter 5::, we will see that any iterative process
can be realized "in hardware" as a machine that has a fixed set of
registers and no auxiliary memory.  In contrast, realizing a recursive
process requires a machine that uses an auxiliary data structure known
as a "stack".
</p>

<p>
(3) Tail recursion has long been known as a compiler optimization
trick.  A coherent semantic basis for tail recursion was provided by
Carl Hewitt (1977), who explained it in terms of the "message-passing"
model of computation that we shall discuss in *Note Chapter 3::.
Inspired by this, Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy Lewis Steele Jr. (see
Steele 1975) constructed a tail-recursive interpreter for Scheme.
Steele later showed how tail recursion is a consequence of the natural
way to compile procedure calls (Steele 1977).  The IEEE standard for
Scheme requires that Scheme implementations be tail-recursive.

<p>
Another common pattern of computation is called "tree recursion".  As
an example, consider computing the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, in
which each number is the sum of the preceding two:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org85cb6d8">
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
</pre>

<p>
In general, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by the rule
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org9830b64">
         /
         |  0                        if n = 0
Fib(n) = &lt;  1                        if n = 1
         |  Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2)  otherwise

We can immediately translate this definition into a recursive

</pre>

<p>
Consider the pattern of this computation.  To compute `(fib 5)', we
compute `(fib 4)' and `(fib 3)'.  To compute `(fib 4)', we compute
`(fib 3)' and `(fib 2)'.  In general, the evolved process looks like a
tree, as shown in *Note Figure 1-5::.  Notice that the branches split
into two at each level (except at the bottom); this reflects the fact
that the `fib' procedure calls itself twice each time it is invoked.
</p>

<p>
This procedure is instructive as a prototypical tree recursion, but
it is a terrible way to compute Fibonacci numbers because it does so
much redundant computation.  Notice in *Note Figure 1-5:: that the
entire computation of `(fib 3)'&#x2013;almost half the work&#x2013;is duplicated.
In fact, it is not hard to show that the number of times the procedure
will compute `(fib 1)' or `(fib 0)' (the number of leaves in the above
tree, in general) is precisely _Fib<sub>(n + 1)</sub>.  To get an idea of how bad
this is, one can show that the value of _Fib<sub>(n)</sub> grows exponentially
with n.  More precisely (see *Note Exercise 1-13::), _Fib<sub>(n)</sub> is the
closest integer to [phi]<sup>n</sup> /[sqrt](5), where
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgffc5871">
[phi] = (1 + [sqrt]5)/2 ~= 1.6180
</pre>

<p>
is the "golden ratio", which satisfies the equation
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd3ec504">
[phi]^2 = [phi] + 1
</pre>

<p>
Thus, the process uses a number of steps that grows exponentially
with the input.  On the other hand, the space required grows only
linearly with the input, because we need keep track only of which nodes
are above us in the tree at any point in the computation.  In general,
the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be
proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space
required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.
</p>

<p>
We can also formulate an iterative process for computing the
Fibonacci numbers.  The idea is to use a pair of integers a and b,
initialized to _Fib<sub>(1)</sub> = 1 and _Fib<sub>(0)</sub> = 0, and to repeatedly apply
the simultaneous transformations
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgfccc891">
a &lt;- a + b
b &lt;- a
</pre>

<p>
It is not hard to show that, after applying this transformation n times,
a and b will be equal, respectively, to _Fib<sub>(n + 1)</sub> and _Fib<sub>(n)</sub>.
Thus, we can compute Fibonacci numbers iteratively using the procedure
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fib</span> n)
  (fib-iter 1 0 n))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fib-iter</span> a b count)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= count 0)
      b
      (fib-iter (+ a b) a (- count 1))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This second method for computing _Fib<sub>(n)</sub> is a linear iteration.  The
difference in number of steps required by the two methods&#x2013;one linear in
n, one growing as fast as _Fib<sub>(n)</sub> itself&#x2013;is enormous, even for small
inputs.
</p>

<p>
One should not conclude from this that tree-recursive processes are
useless.  When we consider processes that operate on hierarchically
structured data rather than numbers, we will find that tree recursion
is a natural and powerful tool.(1) But even in numerical operations,
tree-recursive processes can be useful in helping us to understand and
design programs.  For instance, although the first `fib' procedure is
much less efficient than the second one, it is more straightforward,
being little more than a translation into Lisp of the definition of the
Fibonacci sequence.  To formulate the iterative algorithm required
noticing that the computation could be recast as an iteration with
three state variables.
</p>

<p>
Example: Counting change
</p>
<hr />

<p>
It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative
Fibonacci algorithm.  In contrast, consider the following problem: How
many different ways can we make change of $ 1.00, given half-dollars,
quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies?  More generally, can we write a
procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of
money?
</p>

<p>
This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.
Suppose we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some
order.  Then the following relation holds:
</p>

<p>
The number of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins equals
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the number of ways to change amount a using all but the first kind
of coin, plus</li>

<li>the number of ways to change amount a - d using all n kinds of
coins, where d is the denomination of the first kind of coin.</li>
</ul>


<p>
To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be
divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of
coin, and those that do.  Therefore, the total number of ways to make
change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make change
for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin, plus the
number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the first kind of
coin.  But the latter number is equal to the number of ways to make
change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first kind.
</p>

<p>
Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given
amount to the problem of changing smaller amounts using fewer kinds of
coins.  Consider this reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself
that we can use it to describe an algorithm if we specify the following
degenerate cases:(2)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.</li>

<li>If a is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.</li>

<li>If n is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.</li>
</ul>


<p>
We can easily translate this description into a recursive procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">count-change</span> amount)

  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((<span class="org-keyword">or</span> (&lt; amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> (+ (cc amount
                     (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                 (cc (- amount
                        (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
                     kinds-of-coins)))))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">first-denomination</span> kinds-of-coins)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)

        ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
        ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
(The `first-denomination' procedure takes as input the number of
kinds of coins available and returns the denomination of the first
kind.  Here we are thinking of the coins as arranged in order from
largest to smallest, but any order would do as well.)  We can now
answer our original question about changing a dollar:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge4c0c30">
(count-change 100)
292
</pre>

<p>
`Count-change' generates a tree-recursive process with redundancies
similar to those in our first implementation of `fib'.  (It will take
quite a while for that 292 to be computed.)  On the other hand, it is
not obvious how to design a better algorithm for computing the result,
and we leave this problem as a challenge.  The observation that a
tree-recursive process may be highly inefficient but often easy to
specify and understand has led people to propose that one could get the
best of both worlds by designing a "smart compiler" that could
transform tree-recursive procedures into more efficient procedures that
compute the same result.(3)

(3) One approach to coping with redundant computations is to arrange
matters so that we automatically construct a table of values as they
are computed.  Each time we are asked to apply the procedure to some
argument, we first look to see if the value is already stored in the
table, in which case we avoid performing the redundant computation.
This strategy, known as "tabulation" or "memoization", can be
implemented in a straightforward way.  Tabulation can sometimes be used
to transform processes that require an exponential number of steps
(such as `count-change') into processes whose space and time
requirements grow linearly with the input.  See *Note Exercise 3-27::.

<p>
(4) The elements of Pascal's triangle are called the "binomial
coefficients", because the nth row consists of the coefficients of the
terms in the expansion of (x + y)<sup>n</sup>.  This pattern for computing the
coefficients appeared in Blaise Pascal's 1653 seminal work on
probability theory, `Traite' du triangle arithme'tique'.  According to
Knuth (1973), the same pattern appears in the `Szu-yuen Yu"-chien'
("The Precious Mirror of the Four Elements"), published by the Chinese
mathematician Chu Shih-chieh in 1303, in the works of the
twelfth-century Persian poet and mathematician Omar Khayyam, and in the
works of the twelfth-century Hindu mathematician Bha'scara A'cha'rya.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<hr />

<p>
The previous examples illustrate that processes can differ considerably
in the rates at which they consume computational resources.  One
convenient way to describe this difference is to use the notion of "order
of growth" to obtain a gross measure of the resources required by a
process as the inputs become larger.
</p>

<p>
Let n be a parameter that measures the size of the problem, and let
R(n) be the amount of resources the process requires for a problem of
size n.  In our previous examples we took n to be the number for which
a given function is to be computed, but there are other possibilities.
For instance, if our goal is to compute an approximation to the square
root of a number, we might take n to be the number of digits accuracy
required.  For matrix multiplication we might take n to be the number
of rows in the matrices.  In general there are a number of properties
of the problem with respect to which it will be desirable to analyze a
given process.  Similarly, R(n) might measure the number of internal
storage registers used, the number of elementary machine operations
performed, and so on.  In computers that do only a fixed number of
operations at a time, the time required will be proportional to the
number of elementary machine operations performed.
</p>

<p>
We say that R(n) has order of growth [theta](f(n)), written R(n) =
[theta](f(n)) (pronounced "theta of f(n)"), if there are positive
constants k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> independent of n such that
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd3b5820">
k_1 f(n) &lt;= R(n) &lt;= k_2 f(n)
</pre>

<p>
for any sufficiently large value of n.  (In other words, for large n,
the value R(n) is sandwiched between k<sub>1f</sub>(n) and k<sub>2f</sub>(n).)
</p>

<p>
For instance, with the linear recursive process for computing
factorial described in section *Note 1-2-1:: the number of steps grows
proportionally to the input n.  Thus, the steps required for this
process grows as [theta](n).  We also saw that the space required grows
as [theta](n).  For the iterative factorial, the number of steps is
still [theta](n) but the space is [theta](1)&#x2013;that is, constant.(1) The
tree-recursive Fibonacci computation requires [theta]([phi]<sup>n</sup>) steps
and space [theta](n), where [phi] is the golden ratio described in
section *Note 1-2-2::.
</p>

<p>
Orders of growth provide only a crude description of the behavior of
a process.  For example, a process requiring n<sup>2</sup> steps and a process
requiring 1000n<sup>2</sup> steps and a process requiring 3n<sup>2</sup> + 10n + 17 steps
all have [theta](n<sup>2</sup>) order of growth.  On the other hand, order of
growth provides a useful indication of how we may expect the behavior
of the process to change as we change the size of the problem.  For a
[theta](n) (linear) process, doubling the size will roughly double the
amount of resources used.  For an exponential process, each increment
in problem size will multiply the resource utilization by a constant
factor.  In the remainder of section *Note 1-2:: we will examine two
algorithms whose order of growth is logarithmic, so that doubling the
problem size increases the resource requirement by a constant amount.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.14:</b> Draw the tree illustrating the process generated
by the `count-change' procedure of section *Note 1-2-2:: in making
change for 11 cents.  What are the orders of growth of the space

changed increases?

<b>Exercise 1.15:</b> The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can

<p>
(1) These statements mask a great deal of oversimplification.  For
instance, if we count process steps as "machine operations" we are
making the assumption that the number of machine operations needed to
perform, say, a multiplication is independent of the size of the
numbers to be multiplied, which is false if the numbers are
sufficiently large.  Similar remarks hold for the estimates of space.
Like the design and description of a process, the analysis of a process
can be carried out at various levels of abstraction.

<p>
Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number.
We would like a procedure that takes as arguments a base b and a
positive integer exponent n and computes b<sup>n</sup>.  One way to do this is
via the recursive definition
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org72bd4b1">
b^n = b * b^(n - 1)
b^0 = 1
</pre>

<p>
which translates readily into the procedure
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">expt</span> b n)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= n 0)
      1
      (* b (expt b (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a linear recursive process, which requires [theta](n) steps
and [theta](n) space.  Just as with factorial, we can readily formulate
an equivalent linear iteration:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">expt</span> b n)
  (expt-iter b n 1))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">expt-iter</span> b counter product)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= counter 0)
      product
      (expt-iter b
                (- counter 1)
                (* b product))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This version requires [theta](n) steps and [theta](1) space.
</p>

<p>
We can compute exponentials in fewer steps by using successive
squaring.  For instance, rather than computing b<sup>8</sup> as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga1796c6">
b * (b * (b * (b * (b * (b * (b * b))))))
</pre>

<p>
we can compute it using three multiplications:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8f97d27">
b^2 = b * b
b^4 = b^2 * b^2
b^8 = b^4 * b^4
</pre>

<p>
This method works fine for exponents that are powers of 2.  We can
also take advantage of successive squaring in computing exponentials in
general if we use the rule
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org4593bbc">
b^n = (b^(b/2))^2    if n is even
b^n = b * b^(n - 1)  if n is odd
</pre>

<p>
We can express this method as a procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fast-expt</span> b n)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((= n 0) 1)
        ((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
where the predicate to test whether an integer is even is defined in
terms of the primitive procedure `remainder' by
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">even?</span> n)
  (= (remainder n 2) 0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The process evolved by `fast-expt' grows logarithmically with n in
both space and number of steps.  To see this, observe that computing
b<sup>(2n)</sup> using `fast-expt' requires only one more multiplication than
computing b<sup>n</sup>.  The size of the exponent we can compute therefore
doubles (approximately) with every new multiplication we are allowed.
Thus, the number of multiplications required for an exponent of n grows
about as fast as the logarithm of n to the base 2.  The process has
[theta](`log' n) growth.(1)
</p>

<p>
The difference between [theta](`log' n) growth and [theta](n) growth
becomes striking as n becomes large.  For example, `fast-expt' for n =
1000 requires only 14 multiplications.(2) It is also possible to use
the idea of successive squaring to devise an iterative algorithm that
computes exponentials with a logarithmic number of steps (see *Note
Exercise 1-16::), although, as is often the case with iterative
algorithms, this is not written down so straightforwardly as the
recursive algorithm.(3)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.16:</b> Design a procedure that evolves an iterative
exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a
logarithmic number of steps, as does `fast-expt'.  (Hint: Using the
observation that <code>(b^(n/2))^2 = (b^2)^(n/2)</code>, keep, along with the
exponent n and the base b, an additional state variable a, and
define the state transformation in such a way that the product a
b<sup>n</sup> is unchanged from state to state.  At the beginning of the
process a is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value
of a at the end of the process.  In general, the technique of
defining an "invariant quantity" that remains unchanged from state
to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative
algorithms.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.17:</b> The exponentiation algorithms in this section are
based on performing exponentiation by means of repeated
multiplication.  In a similar way, one can perform integer
multiplication by means of repeated addition.  The following
multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language
can only add, not multiply) is analogous to the `expt' procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">*</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= b 0)
      0
      (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in `b'.  Now
suppose we include, together with addition, operations `double',
which doubles an integer, and `halve', which divides an (even)
integer by 2.  Using these, design a multiplication procedure
analogous to `fast-expt' that uses a logarithmic number of steps.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.18:</b> Using the results of *Note Exercise 1-16:: and
*Note Exercise 1-17::, devise a procedure that generates an
iterative process for multiplying two integers in terms of adding,
doubling, and halving and uses a logarithmic number of steps.(4)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.19:</b> There is a clever algorithm for computing the
Fibonacci numbers in a logarithmic number of steps.  Recall the
transformation of the state variables a and b in the `fib-iter'
process of section *Note 1-2-2::: a &lt;- a + b and b &lt;- a.  Call
this transformation T, and observe that applying T over and over
again n times, starting with 1 and 0, produces the pair <code>_Fib_(n + 1)</code>
and <code>_Fib_(n)</code>.  In other words, the Fibonacci numbers are
produced by applying T<sup>n</sup>, the nth power of the transformation T,
starting with the pair (1,0).  Now consider T to be the special
case of p = 0 and q = 1 in a family of transformations <code>T_(pq)</code>,
where <code>T_(pq)</code> transforms the pair (a,b) according to a &lt;- bq + aq +
ap and b &lt;- bp + aq.  Show that if we apply such a transformation
<code>T_(pq)</code> twice, the effect is the same as using a single
transformation T<sub>(p'q')</sub> of the same form, and compute p' and q' in
terms of p and q.  This gives us an explicit way to square these
transformations, and thus we can compute T<sup>n</sup> using successive
squaring, as in the `fast-expt' procedure.  Put this all together
to complete the following procedure, which runs in a logarithmic
number of steps:(5)

(1) More precisely, the number of multiplications required is equal
to 1 less than the log base 2 of n plus the number of ones in the
binary representation of n.  This total is always less than twice the
log base 2 of n.  The arbitrary constants k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub> in the definition
of order notation imply that, for a logarithmic process, the base to
which logarithms are taken does not matter, so all such processes are
described as [theta](`log' n).

<h3 id="orgd74dcaa"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Greatest Common Divisors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">
<hr />

<p>
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers a and b is defined to
be the largest integer that divides both a and b with no remainder.
For example, the GCD of 16 and 28 is 4.  In *Note Chapter 2::, when we
investigate how to implement rational-number arithmetic, we will need
to be able to compute GCDs in order to reduce rational numbers to
lowest terms.  (To reduce a rational number to lowest terms, we must
divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD.  For
example, 16/28 reduces to 4/7.)  One way to find the GCD of two
integers is to factor them and search for common factors, but there is
a famous algorithm that is much more efficient.
</p>

<p>
The idea of the algorithm is based on the observation that, if r is
the remainder when a is divided by b, then the common divisors of a and
b are precisely the same as the common divisors of b and r.  Thus, we
can use the equation
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org81c9d69">
GCD(a,b) = GCD(b,r)
</pre>

<p>
to successively reduce the problem of computing a GCD to the problem of
computing the GCD of smaller and smaller pairs of integers.  For
example,
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org9268ce7">
GCD(206,40) = GCD(40,6)
            = GCD(6,4)
            = GCD(4,2)
            = GCD(2,0)
            = 2
</pre>

<p>
reduces GCD(206,40) to GCD(2,0), which is 2.  It is possible to show
that starting with any two positive integers and performing repeated
reductions will always eventually produce a pair where the second
number is 0.  Then the GCD is the other number in the pair.  This
method for computing the GCD is known as Algorithm "Euclid's
Algorithm".(1)
</p>

<p>
It is easy to express Euclid's Algorithm as a procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">gcd</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This generates an iterative process, whose number of steps grows as
the logarithm of the numbers involved.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the number of steps required by Euclid's Algorithm has
logarithmic growth bears an interesting relation to the Fibonacci
numbers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Lame''s Theorem:</b> If Euclid's Algorithm requires k steps to
compute the GCD of some pair, then the smaller number in the pair
must be greater than or equal to the kth Fibonacci number.(2)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can use this theorem to get an order-of-growth estimate for
Euclid's Algorithm.  Let n be the smaller of the two inputs to the
procedure.  If the process takes k steps, then we must have n&gt;= _Fib<sub>(k)</sub>
approx [phi]<sup>k</sup>/[sqrt](5).  Therefore the number of steps k grows as the
logarithm (to the base [phi]) of n.  Hence, the order of growth is
[theta](`log' n).
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.20:</b> The process that a procedure generates is of
course dependent on the rules used by the interpreter.  As an
example, consider the iterative `gcd' procedure given above.
Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order
evaluation, as discussed in section *Note 1-1-5::.  (The
normal-order-evaluation rule for `if' is described in *Note
Exercise 1-5::.)  Using the substitution method (for normal
order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating `(gcd 206
40)' and indicate the `remainder' operations that are actually
performed.  How many `remainder' operations are actually performed
in the normal-order evaluation of `(gcd 206 40)'?  In the
applicative-order evaluation?

(1) Euclid's Algorithm is so called because it appears in Euclid's
`Elements' (Book 7, ca. 300 B.C.).  According to Knuth (1973), it can
be considered the oldest known nontrivial algorithm.  The ancient
Egyptian method of multiplication (*Note Exercise 1-18::) is surely
older, but, as Knuth explains, Euclid's algorithm is the oldest known
to have been presented as a general algorithm, rather than as a set of
illustrative examples.
</p>

<p>
(2) This theorem was proved in 1845 by Gabriel Lame', a French
mathematician and engineer known chiefly for his contributions to
mathematical physics.  To prove the theorem, we consider pairs (a<sub>k</sub>
,b<sub>k</sub>), where a<sub>k</sub>&gt;= b<sub>k</sub>, for which Euclid's Algorithm terminates in k
steps.  The proof is based on the claim that, if (a<sub>(k+1)</sub>, b<sub>(k+1)</sub>) -&gt;
(a<sub>k</sub>, b<sub>k</sub>) -&gt; (a<sub>(k-1)</sub>, b<sub>(k-1)</sub>) are three successive pairs in the
reduction process, then we must have b<sub>(k+1)</sub>&gt;= b<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>(k-1)</sub>.  To
verify the claim, consider that a reduction step is defined by applying
the transformation a<sub>(k-1)</sub> = b<sub>k</sub>, b<sub>(k-1)</sub> = remainder of a<sub>k</sub> divided by
b<sub>k</sub>.  The second equation means that a<sub>k</sub> = qb<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>(k-1)</sub> for some
positive integer q.  And since q must be at least 1 we have a<sub>k</sub> = qb<sub>k</sub>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>b<sub>(k-1)</sub> &gt;= b<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>(k-1)</sub>.  But in the previous reduction step we have</li>
</ul>
<p>
b<sub>(k+1)</sub> = a<sub>k</sub>.  Therefore, b<sub>(k+1)</sub> = a<sub>k</sub>&gt;= b<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>(k-1)</sub>.  This verifies
the claim.  Now we can prove the theorem by induction on k, the number
of steps that the algorithm requires to terminate.  The result is true
for k = 1, since this merely requires that b be at least as large as
_Fib<sub>(1)</sub> = 1.  Now, assume that the result is true for all integers
less than or equal to k and establish the result for k + 1.  Let
(a<sub>(k+1)</sub>, b<sub>(k+1)</sub>) -&gt; (a<sub>k</sub>, b<sub>k</sub>) -&gt; (a<sub>k</sub>-1), b<sub>(k-1)</sub>) be successive
pairs in the reduction process.  By our induction hypotheses, we have
b<sub>(k-1)</sub> &gt;= _Fib<sub>(k - 1)</sub> and b<sub>k</sub> &gt;= _Fib<sub>(k)</sub>.  Thus, applying the claim
we just proved together with the definition of the Fibonacci numbers
gives b<sub>(k+1)</sub> &gt;= b<sub>k</sub> + b<sub>(k-1)</sub> &gt;= _Fib<sub>(k)</sub> + _Fib<sub>(k - 1)</sub> = _Fib<sub>(k +
1)</sub>, which completes the proof of Lame''s Theorem.

<hr />

<p>
This section describes two methods for checking the primality of an
integer n, one with order of growth [theta](_[sqrt]<sub>(n)</sub>), and a
"probabilistic" algorithm with order of growth [theta](`log' n).  The
exercises at the end of this section suggest programming projects based
on these algorithms.

<p>
Searching for divisors
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated by problems
concerning prime numbers, and many people have worked on the problem of
determining ways to test if numbers are prime.  One way to test if a
number is prime is to find the number's divisors.  The following
program finds the smallest integral divisor (greater than 1) of a given
number n.  It does this in a straightforward way, by testing n for
divisibility by successive integers starting with 2.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">smallest-divisor</span> n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">find-divisor</span> n test-divisor)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((&gt; (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1)))))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">divides?</span> a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can test whether a number is prime as follows: n is prime if and
only if n is its own smallest divisor.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">prime?</span> n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The end test for `find-divisor' is based on the fact that if n is not
prime it must have a divisor less than or equal to <code>_[sqrt]_(n)</code>.(1)
This means that the algorithm need only test divisors between 1 and
<code>_[sqrt]_(n)</code>.  Consequently, the number of steps required to identify n
as prime will have order of growth <code>[theta](_[sqrt]_(n))</code>.
</p>

<p>
The Fermat test
</p>
<hr />

<p>
The <code>[theta](`log' n)</code> primality test is based on a result from number
theory known as Fermat's Little Theorem.(2)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Fermat's Little Theorem:</b> If n is a prime number and a is any
positive integer less than n, then a raised to the nth power is
congruent to a modulo n.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Two numbers are said to be "congruent modulo" n if they both have
the same remainder when divided by n.  The remainder of a number a when
divided by n is also referred to as the "remainder of" a "modulo" n, or
simply as a "modulo" n.)
</p>

<p>
If n is not prime, then, in general, most of the numbers a&lt; n will
not satisfy the above relation.  This leads to the following algorithm
for testing primality: Given a number n, pick a random number a &lt; n and
compute the remainder of a<sup>n</sup> modulo n.  If the result is not equal to
a, then n is certainly not prime.  If it is a, then chances are good
that n is prime.  Now pick another random number a and test it with the
same method.  If it also satisfies the equation, then we can be even
more confident that n is prime.  By trying more and more values of a,
we can increase our confidence in the result.  This algorithm is known
as the Fermat test.
</p>

<p>
To implement the Fermat test, we need a procedure that computes the
exponential of a number modulo another number:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">expmod</span> base exp m)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span>
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is very similar to the `fast-expt' procedure of section *Note
1-2-4::.  It uses successive squaring, so that the number of steps
grows logarithmically with the exponent.(3)
</p>

<p>
The Fermat test is performed by choosing at random a number a
between 1 and n - 1 inclusive and checking whether the remainder modulo
n of the nth power of a is equal to a.  The random number a is chosen
using the procedure `random', which we assume is included as a primitive
in Scheme. `Random' returns a nonnegative integer less than its integer
input.  Hence, to obtain a random number between 1 and n - 1, we call
`random' with an input of n - 1 and add 1 to the result:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fermat-test</span> n)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">try-it</span> a)
    (= (expmod a n n) a))
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following procedure runs the test a given number of times, as
specified by a parameter.  Its value is true if the test succeeds every
time, and false otherwise.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fast-prime?</span> n times)
  (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((= times 0) true)
        ((fermat-test n) (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
        (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> false)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Probabilistic methods
</p>
<hr />

<p>
The Fermat test differs in character from most familiar algorithms, in
which one computes an answer that is guaranteed to be correct.  Here,
the answer obtained is only probably correct.  More precisely, if n
ever fails the Fermat test, we can be certain that n is not prime.  But
the fact that n passes the test, while an extremely strong indication,
is still not a guarantee that n is prime.  What we would like to say is
that for any number n, if we perform the test enough times and find
that n always passes the test, then the probability of error in our
primality test can be made as small as we like.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this assertion is not quite correct.  There do exist
numbers that fool the Fermat test: numbers n that are not prime and yet
have the property that a<sup>n</sup> is congruent to a modulo n for all integers
a &lt; n.  Such numbers are extremely rare, so the Fermat test is quite
reliable in practice.(4)
</p>

<p>
There are variations of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled.  In
these tests, as with the Fermat method, one tests the primality of an
integer n by choosing a random integer a&lt;n and checking some condition
that depends upon n and a.  (See *Note Exercise 1-28:: for an example
of such a test.)  On the other hand, in contrast to the Fermat test,
one can prove that, for any n, the condition does not hold for most of
the integers a&lt;n unless n is prime.  Thus, if n passes the test for
some random choice of a, the chances are better than even that n is
prime.  If n passes the test for two random choices of a, the chances
are better than 3 out of 4 that n is prime. By running the test with
more and more randomly chosen values of a we can make the probability
of error as small as we like.
</p>

<p>
The existence of tests for which one can prove that the chance of
error becomes arbitrarily small has sparked interest in algorithms of
this type, which have come to be known as "probabilistic algorithms".
There is a great deal of research activity in this area, and
probabilistic algorithms have been fruitfully applied to many fields.(5)

<b>Exercise 1.21:</b> Use the `smallest-divisor' procedure to find the
smallest divisor of each of the following numbers: 199, 1999, 19999.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.22:</b> Most Lisp implementations include a primitive
called `runtime' that returns an integer that specifies the amount
of time the system has been running (measured, for example, in
microseconds).  The following `timed-prime-test' procedure, when
called with an integer n, prints n and checks to see if n is
prime.  If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks
followed by the amount of time used in performing the test.
</p>

Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes' that
checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified
range.  Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes
larger than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger
than 1,000,000.  Note the time needed to test each prime.  Since
the testing algorithm has order of growth of <code>[theta](_[sqrt]_(n))</code>,
you should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should
take about <code>_[sqrt]_(10)</code> times as long as testing for primes around

for the computation?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.23:</b> The `smallest-divisor' procedure shown at the
start of this section does lots of needless testing: After it
checks to see if the number is divisible by 2 there is no point in
checking to see if it is divisible by any larger even numbers.
This suggests that the values used for `test-divisor' should not
be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &#x2026;, but rather 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, &#x2026;.  To
implement this change, define a procedure `next' that returns 3 if
its input is equal to 2 and otherwise returns its input plus 2.
Modify the `smallest-divisor' procedure to use `(next
test-divisor)' instead of `(+ test-divisor 1)'.  With
`timed-prime-test' incorporating this modified version of
`smallest-divisor', run the test for each of the 12 primes found in
*Note Exercise 1-22::.  Since this modification halves the number
of test steps, you should expect it to run about twice as fast.
Is this expectation confirmed?  If not, what is the observed ratio
of the speeds of the two algorithms, and how do you explain the
fact that it is different from 2?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.24:</b> Modify the `timed-prime-test' procedure of *Note
Exercise 1-22:: to use `fast-prime?' (the Fermat method), and test
each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise.  Since the
Fermat test has [theta](`log' n) growth, how would you expect the
time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed
to test primes near 1000?  Do your data bear this out?  Can you
explain any discrepancy you find?
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.25:</b> Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot
of extra work in writing `expmod'.  After all, she says, since we

has rewritten the `expmod' procedure to use an explicit
multiplication, rather than calling `square':

<p>
"I don't see what difference that could make," says Louis.  "I
do."  says Eva.  "By writing the procedure like that, you have
transformed the [theta](`log' n) process into a [theta](n)

</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.27:</b> Demonstrate that the Carmichael numbers listed in
*Note Footnote 1-47:: really do fool the Fermat test.  That is,
write a procedure that takes an integer n and tests whether a<sup>n</sup> is
congruent to a modulo n for every a&lt;n, and try your procedure on
the given Carmichael numbers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.28:</b> One variant of the Fermat test that cannot be
fooled is called the "Miller-Rabin test" (Miller 1976; Rabin
1980).  This starts from an alternate form of Fermat's Little
Theorem, which states that if n is a prime number and a is any
positive integer less than n, then a raised to the (n - 1)st power
is congruent to 1 modulo n.  To test the primality of a number n
by the Miller-Rabin test, we pick a random number a&lt;n and raise a
to the (n - 1)st power modulo n using the `expmod' procedure.
However, whenever we perform the squaring step in `expmod', we
check to see if we have discovered a "nontrivial square root of 1
modulo n," that is, a number not equal to 1 or n - 1 whose square
is equal to 1 modulo n.  It is possible to prove that if such a
nontrivial square root of 1 exists, then n is not prime.  It is
also possible to prove that if n is an odd number that is not
prime, then, for at least half the numbers a&lt;n, computing a<sup>(n-1)</sup>
in this way will reveal a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo n.
(This is why the Miller-Rabin test cannot be fooled.)  Modify the
`expmod' procedure to signal if it discovers a nontrivial square
root of 1, and use this to implement the Miller-Rabin test with a
procedure analogous to `fermat-test'.  Check your procedure by
testing various known primes and non-primes.  Hint: One convenient
way to make `expmod' signal is to have it return 0.

(1) If d is a divisor of n, then so is n/d.  But d and n/d cannot
both be greater than <code>_[sqrt]_(n)</code>.

(2) Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) is considered to be the founder of
modern number theory.  He obtained many important number-theoretic
results, but he usually announced just the results, without providing
his proofs.  Fermat's Little Theorem was stated in a letter he wrote in
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The first published proof was given by Euler in 1736 (and an</li>
</ol>
<p>
earlier, identical proof was discovered in the unpublished manuscripts
of Leibniz).  The most famous of Fermat's results&#x2013;known as Fermat's
Last Theorem&#x2013;was jotted down in 1637 in his copy of the book
`Arithmetic' (by the third-century Greek mathematician Diophantus) with
the remark "I have discovered a truly remarkable proof, but this margin
is too small to contain it."  Finding a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem
became one of the most famous challenges in number theory.  A complete
solution was finally given in 1995 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton
University.
</p>

<p>
(3) The reduction steps in the cases where the exponent e is greater
than 1 are based on the fact that, for any integers x, y, and m, we can
find the remainder of x times y modulo m by computing separately the
remainders of x modulo m and y modulo m, multiplying these, and then
taking the remainder of the result modulo m.  For instance, in the case
where e is even, we compute the remainder of b<sup>(e/2)</sup> modulo m, square
this, and take the remainder modulo m.  This technique is useful
because it means we can perform our computation without ever having to
deal with numbers much larger than m.  (Compare *Note Exercise 1-25::.)
</p>

<p>
(4) [Footnote 1.47] Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called "Carmichael
numbers", and little is known about them other than that they are
extremely rare.  There are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000.
The smallest few are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601.  In testing
primality of very large numbers chosen at random, the chance of
stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the
chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error
in carrying out a "correct" algorithm.  Considering an algorithm to be
inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the
difference between mathematics and engineering.
</p>

<p>
(5) One of the most striking applications of probabilistic prime
testing has been to the field of cryptography.  Although it is now
computationally infeasible to factor an arbitrary 200-digit number, the
primality of such a number can be checked in a few seconds with the
Fermat test.  This fact forms the basis of a technique for constructing
"unbreakable codes" suggested by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (1977).
The resulting "RSA algorithm" has become a widely used technique for
enhancing the security of electronic communications.  Because of this
and related developments, the study of prime numbers, once considered
the epitome of a topic in "pure" mathematics to be studied only for its
own sake, now turns out to have important practical applications to
cryptography, electronic funds transfer, and information retrieval.

<h2 id="org5e9ba96"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
We have seen that procedures are, in effect, abstractions that describe
compound operations on numbers independent of the particular numbers.
For example, when we
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">cube</span> x) (* x x x))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
we are not talking about the cube of a particular number, but rather
about a method for obtaining the cube of any number.  Of course we
could get along without ever defining this procedure, by always writing
expressions such as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(* 3 3 3)
(* x x x)
(* y y y)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and never mentioning `cube' explicitly.  This would place us at a
serious disadvantage, forcing us to work always at the level of the
particular operations that happen to be primitives in the language
(multiplication, in this case) rather than in terms of higher-level
operations.  Our programs would be able to compute cubes, but our
language would lack the ability to express the concept of cubing.  One
of the things we should demand from a powerful programming language is
the ability to build abstractions by assigning names to common patterns
and then to work in terms of the abstractions directly.  Procedures
provide this ability.  This is why all but the most primitive
programming languages include mechanisms for defining procedures.
</p>

<p>
Yet even in numerical processing we will be severely limited in our
ability to create abstractions if we are restricted to procedures whose
parameters must be numbers.  Often the same programming pattern will be
used with a number of different procedures.  To express such patterns
as concepts, we will need to construct procedures that can accept
procedures as arguments or return procedures as values.  Procedures
that manipulate procedures are called "higher-order procedures".  This
section shows how higher-order procedures can serve as powerful
abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our
language.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<hr />

<p>
Consider the following three procedures.  The first computes the sum of
the integers from `a' through `b':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sum-integers</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&gt; a b)
      0
      (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The second computes the sum of the cubes of the integers in the
given range:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sum-cubes</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&gt; a b)
      0
      (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The third computes the sum of a sequence of terms in the series
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org89bec7f">
  1       1       1
----- + ----- + ------ + ...
1 * 3   5 * 7   9 * 11
</pre>

<p>
which converges to [pi]/8 (very slowly):(1)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">pi-sum</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&gt; a b)
      0
      (+ (/ 1.0 (* a (+ a 2))) (pi-sum (+ a 4) b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
These three procedures clearly share a common underlying pattern.
They are for the most part identical, differing only in the name of the
procedure, the function of `a' used to compute the term to be added,
and the function that provides the next value of `a'.  We could
generate each of the procedures by filling in slots in the same
template:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgac15903">
(define (&lt;NAME&gt; a b)
  (if (&gt; a b)
      0
      (+ (&lt;TERM&gt; a)
         (&lt;NAME&gt; (&lt;NEXT&gt; a) b))))
</pre>

<p>
The presence of such a common pattern is strong evidence that there
is a useful abstraction waiting to be brought to the surface.  Indeed,
mathematicians long ago identified the abstraction of "summation of a
series" and invented "sigma notation," for example
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8cdb9ff">
 b
---
&gt;    f(n) = f(a) + ... + f(b)
---
n=a
</pre>

<p>
to express this concept.  The power of sigma notation is that it allows
mathematicians to deal with the concept of summation itself rather than
only with particular sums&#x2013;for example, to formulate general results
about sums that are independent of the particular series being summed.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, as program designers, we would like our language to be
powerful enough so that we can write a procedure that expresses the
concept of summation itself rather than only procedures that compute
particular sums.  We can do so readily in our procedural language by
taking the common template shown above and transforming the "slots"
into formal parameters:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sum</span> term a next b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (&gt; a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that `sum' takes as its arguments the lower and upper bounds
`a' and `b' together with the procedures `term' and `next'.  We can use
`sum' just as we would any procedure.  For example, we can use it
(along with a procedure `inc' that increments its argument by 1) to
define `sum-cubes':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">inc</span> n) (+ n 1))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sum-cubes</span> a b)
  (sum cube a inc b))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using this, we can compute the sum of the cubes of the integers from
1 to 10:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga659d40">
(sum-cubes 1 10)

<p>
With the aid of an identity procedure to compute the term, we can
define `sum-integers' in terms of `sum':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">identity</span> x) x)

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sum-integers</span> a b)
  (sum identity a inc b))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we can add up the integers from 1 to 10:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5e3929a">
(sum-integers 1 10)
55
</pre>

<p>
We can also define `pi-sum' in the same way:(2)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">pi-sum</span> a b)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">pi-term</span> x)
    (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">pi-next</span> x)
    (+ x 4))
  (sum pi-term a pi-next b))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using these procedures, we can compute an approximation to [pi]:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org219fa23">
(* 8 (pi-sum 1 1000))
3.139592655589783
</pre>

<p>
Once we have `sum', we can use it as a building block in formulating
further concepts.  For instance, the definite integral of a function f
between the limits a and b can be approximated numerically using the
formula
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org43a69c5">
/b     /  /     dx \    /          dx \    /           dx \      \
|  f = | f| a + -- | + f| a + dx + -- | + f| a + 2dx + -- | + ...| dx
/a     \  \     2  /    \          2  /    \           2  /      /
</pre>

<p>
for small values of dx.  We can express this directly as a procedure:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2c668fd">
(define (integral f a b dx)
  (define (add-dx x) (+ x dx))
  (* (sum f (+ a (/ dx 2.0)) add-dx b)
     dx))

(integral cube 0 1 0.01)
.24998750000000042

(integral cube 0 1 0.001)
.249999875000001
</pre>

<p>
(The exact value of the integral of `cube' between 0 and 1 is 1/4.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.29:</b> Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of
numerical integration than the method illustrated above.  Using
Simpson's Rule, the integral of a function f between a and b is
approximated as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf7c5014">
h
- (y_0 + 4y_1 + 2y_2 + 4y_3 + 2y_4 + ... + 2y_(n-2) + 4y_(n-1) + y_n)
3
</pre>

<p>
where h = (b - a)/n, for some even integer n, and y<sub>k</sub> = f(a + kh).
(Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.)
Define a procedure that takes as arguments f, a, b, and n and
returns the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule.
Use your procedure to integrate `cube' between 0 and 1 (with n =
100 and n = 1000), and compare the results to those of the
`integral' procedure shown above.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.30:</b> The `sum' procedure above generates a linear
recursion.  The procedure can be rewritten so that the sum is
performed iteratively.  Show how to do this by filling in the
missing expressions in the following definition:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc6a0961">
(define (sum term a next b)
  (define (iter a result)
    (if &lt;??&gt;
        &lt;??&gt;
        (iter &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;)))
  (iter &lt;??&gt; &lt;??&gt;))
</pre>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.31:</b>
a. The `sum' procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of
similar abstractions that can be captured as higher-order
procedures.(3)  Write an analogous procedure called `product'
that returns the product of the values of a function at
points over a given range.  Show how to define `factorial' in
terms of `product'.  Also use `product' to compute
approximations to [pi] using the formula(4)
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge69eecd">
pi   2 * 4 * 4 * 6 * 6 * 8 ...
-- = -------------------------
 4   3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 7 ...
</pre>

<p>
b. If your `product' procedure generates a recursive process,
write one that generates an iterative process.  If it
generates an iterative process, write one that generates a
recursive process.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 1.32:</b>
a. Show that `sum' and `product' (*Note Exercise 1-31::) are
both special cases of a still more general notion called
`accumulate' that combines a collection of terms, using some
general accumulation function:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd1666e1">
(accumulate combiner null-value term a next b)
</pre>

<p>
`Accumulate' takes as arguments the same term and range
specifications as `sum' and `product', together with a
`combiner' procedure (of two arguments) that specifies how
the current term is to be combined with the accumulation of
the preceding terms and a `null-value' that specifies what
base value to use when the terms run out.  Write `accumulate'
and show how `sum' and `product' can both be defined as
simple calls to `accumulate'.
</p>

<p>
b. If your `accumulate' procedure generates a recursive process,
write one that generates an iterative process.  If it
generates an iterative process, write one that generates a
recursive process.
</p>


<p>
<b>Exercise 1.33:</b> You can obtain an even more general version of
`accumulate' (*Note Exercise 1-32::) by introducing the notion of
a "filter" on the terms to be combined.  That is, combine only
those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a
specified condition.  The resulting `filtered-accumulate'
abstraction takes the same arguments as accumulate, together with
an additional predicate of one argument that specifies the filter.
Write `filtered-accumulate' as a procedure.  Show how to express
the following using `filtered-accumulate':
</p>

<p>
a. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a
to b (assuming that you have a `prime?' predicate already
written)
</p>

<p>
b. the product of all the positive integers less than n that are
relatively prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i &lt; n such
that GCD(i,n) = 1).
</p>

</p>

<p>
(3) The intent of *Note Exercise 1-31:: through *Note Exercise
1-33:: is to demonstrate the expressive power that is attained by using
an appropriate abstraction to consolidate many seemingly disparate
operations.  However, though accumulation and filtering are elegant
ideas, our hands are somewhat tied in using them at this point since we
do not yet have data structures to provide suitable means of
combination for these abstractions.  We will return to these ideas in
section *Note 2-2-3:: when we show how to use "sequences" as interfaces
for combining filters and accumulators to build even more powerful
abstractions.  We will see there how these methods really come into
their own as a powerful and elegant approach to designing programs.

<h3 id="orga32584b"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Constructing Procedures Using `Lambda'</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<hr />

<p>
In using `sum' as in section *Note 1-3-1::, it seems terribly awkward to
have to define trivial procedures such as `pi-term' and `pi-next' just
so we can use them as arguments to our higher-order procedure.  Rather
than define `pi-next' and `pi-term', it would be more convenient to
have a way to directly specify "the procedure that returns its input
incremented by 4" and "the procedure that returns the reciprocal of its
input times its input plus 2."  We can do this by introducing the
special form `lambda', which creates procedures.  Using `lambda' we can
describe what we want as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (+ x 4))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
and
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then our `pi-sum' procedure can be expressed without defining any
auxiliary procedures as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">pi-sum</span> a b)
  (sum (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
       a
       (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (+ x 4))
       b))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Again using `lambda', we can write the `integral' procedure without
having to define the auxiliary procedure `add-dx':
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">integral</span> f a b dx)
  (* (sum f
          (+ a (/ dx 2.0))
          (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (+ x dx))
          b)
     dx))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In general, `lambda' is used to create procedures in the same way as
`define', except that no name is specified for the procedure:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8c55a05">
(lambda (&lt;FORMAL-PARAMETERS&gt;) &lt;BODY&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
The resulting procedure is just as much a procedure as one that is
created using `define'.  The only difference is that it has not been
associated with any name in the environment.  In fact,
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">plus4</span> x) (+ x 4))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
is equivalent to
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">plus4</span> (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (+ x 4)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We can read a `lambda' expression as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd37e8dc">
(lambda                     (x)     (+   x     4))
    |                        |       |   |     |
the procedure of an argument x that adds x and 4
</pre>

<p>
Like any expression that has a procedure as its value, a `lambda'
expression can be used as the operator in a combination such as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd2700cb">
((lambda (x y z) (+ x y (square z))) 1 2 3)
12
</pre>

<p>
or, more generally, in any context where we would normally use a
procedure name.(1)
</p>

<p>
Using `let' to create local variables
</p>
<hr />

<p>
Another use of `lambda' is in creating local variables.  We often need
local variables in our procedures other than those that have been bound
as formal parameters.  For example, suppose we wish to compute the
function
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8451bca">
f(x,y) = x(1 + xy)^2 + y(1 - y) + (1 + xy)(1 - y)
</pre>

<p>
which we could also express as
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org41dab81">
     a = 1 + xy
     b = 1 - y
f(x,y) = xa^2 + yb + ab
</pre>

<p>
In writing a procedure to compute f, we would like to include as
local variables not only x and y but also the names of intermediate
quantities like a and b.  One way to accomplish this is to use an
auxiliary procedure to bind the local variables:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f</span> x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f-helper</span> a b)
    (+ (* x (square a))
       (* y b)
       (* a b)))
  (f-helper (+ 1 (* x y))
            (- 1 y)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Of course, we could use a `lambda' expression to specify an anonymous
procedure for binding our local variables.  The body of `f' then
becomes a single call to that procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f</span> x y)
  ((<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (a b)
     (+ (* x (square a))
        (* y b)
        (* a b)))
   (+ 1 (* x y))
   (- 1 y)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This construct is so useful that there is a special form called
`let' to make its use more convenient.  Using `let', the `f' procedure
could be written as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f</span> x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((a (+ 1 (* x y)))
        (b (- 1 y)))
    (+ (* x (square a))
       (* y b)
       (* a b))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The general form of a `let' expression is
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgf7e55ed">
(let ((&lt;VAR1&gt; &lt;EXP1&gt;)
      (&lt;VAR2&gt; &lt;EXP2&gt;)
      ...
      (&lt;VARN&gt; &lt;VARN&gt;))
   &lt;BODY&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
which can be thought of as saying
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orge06a693">
let &lt;VAR_1&gt; have the value &lt;EXP_1&gt; and
    &lt;VAR_2&gt; have the value &lt;EXP_2&gt; and
    ...
    &lt;VAR_N&gt; have the value &lt;EXP_N&gt;
in  &lt;BODY&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The first part of the `let' expression is a list of name-expression
pairs.  When the `let' is evaluated, each name is associated with the
value of the corresponding expression.  The body of the `let' is
evaluated with these names bound as local variables.  The way this
happens is that the `let' expression is interpreted as an alternate
syntax for
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5fe3933">
((lambda (&lt;VAR_1&gt; ... &lt;VAR_N&gt;)
    &lt;BODY&gt;)
 &lt;EXP_1&gt;
 ...
 &lt;EXP_N&gt;)
</pre>

<p>
No new mechanism is required in the interpreter in order to provide
local variables.  A `let' expression is simply syntactic sugar for the
underlying `lambda' application.
</p>

<p>
We can see from this equivalence that the scope of a variable
specified by a `let' expression is the body of the `let'.  This implies
that:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
`Let' allows one to bind variables as locally as possible to where
they are to be used.  For example, if the value of `x' is 5, the
value of the expression
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(+ (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((x 3))
     (+ x (* x 10)))
   x)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
is 38.  Here, the `x' in the body of the `let' is 3, so the value
of the `let' expression is 33.  On the other hand, the `x' that is
the second argument to the outermost `+' is still 5.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The variables' values are computed outside the `let'.  This
matters when the expressions that provide the values for the local
variables depend upon variables having the same names as the local
variables themselves.  For example, if the value of `x' is 2, the
expression
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((x 3)
      (y (+ x 2)))
  (* x y))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
will have the value 12 because, inside the body of the `let', `x'
will be 3 and `y' will be 4 (which is the outer `x' plus 2).
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes we can use internal definitions to get the same effect as
with `let'.  For example, we could have defined the procedure `f' above
as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f</span> x y)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">a</span> (+ 1 (* x y)))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">b</span> (- 1 y))
  (+ (* x (square a))
     (* y b)
     (* a b)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We prefer, however, to use `let' in situations like this and to use
internal `define' only for internal procedures.(2)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.34:</b> Suppose we define the procedure
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">f</span> g)
  (g 2))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then we have
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org86a3ba6">
(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
</pre>

<p>
What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate
the combination `(f f)'?  Explain.
</p>

<p>
(1) It would be clearer and less intimidating to people learning
Lisp if a name more obvious than `lambda', such as `make-procedure',
were used.  But the convention is firmly entrenched.  The notation is
adopted from the [lambda] calculus, a mathematical formalism introduced
by the mathematical logician Alonzo Church (1941).  Church developed
the [lambda] calculus to provide a rigorous foundation for studying the
notions of function and function application.  The [lambda] calculus
has become a basic tool for mathematical investigations of the
semantics of programming languages.
</p>

<p>
(2) Understanding internal definitions well enough to be sure a
program means what we intend it to mean requires a more elaborate model
of the evaluation process than we have presented in this chapter.  The
subtleties do not arise with internal definitions of procedures,
however.  We will return to this issue in section *Note 4-1-6::, after
we learn more about evaluation.

<h3 id="org711ca02"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Procedures as General Methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<hr />

<p>
We introduced compound procedures in section *Note 1-1-4:: as a
mechanism for abstracting patterns of numerical operations so as to
make them independent of the particular numbers involved.  With
higher-order procedures, such as the `integral' procedure of section
*Note 1-3-1::, we began to see a more powerful kind of abstraction:
procedures used to express general methods of computation, independent
of the particular functions involved.  In this section we discuss two
more elaborate examples&#x2013;general methods for finding zeros and fixed
points of functions&#x2013;and show how these methods can be expressed
directly as procedures.
</p>

<p>
Finding roots of equations by the half-interval method
</p>
<hr />

<p>
The "half-interval method" is a simple but powerful technique for
finding roots of an equation f(x) = 0, where f is a continuous
function.  The idea is that, if we are given points a and b such that
f(a) &lt; 0 &lt; f(b), then f must have at least one zero between a and b.
To locate a zero, let x be the average of a and b and compute f(x).  If
f(x) &gt; 0, then f must have a zero between a and x.  If f(x) &lt; 0, then f
must have a zero between x and b.  Continuing in this way, we can
identify smaller and smaller intervals on which f must have a zero.
When we reach a point where the interval is small enough, the process
stops.  Since the interval of uncertainty is reduced by half at each
step of the process, the number of steps required grows as
[theta](`log'( L/T)), where L is the length of the original interval
and T is the error tolerance (that is, the size of the interval we will
consider "small enough").  Here is a procedure that implements this
strategy:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">search</span> f neg-point pos-point)
  (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((midpoint (average neg-point pos-point)))
    (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (close-enough? neg-point pos-point)
        midpoint
        (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((test-value (f midpoint)))
          (<span class="org-keyword">cond</span> ((positive? test-value)
                 (search f neg-point midpoint))
                ((negative? test-value)
                 (search f midpoint pos-point))
                (<span class="org-keyword">else</span> midpoint))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We assume that we are initially given the function f together with
points at which its values are negative and positive.  We first compute
the midpoint of the two given points.  Next we check to see if the
given interval is small enough, and if so we simply return the midpoint
as our answer.  Otherwise, we compute as a test value the value of f at
the midpoint.  If the test value is positive, then we continue the
process with a new interval running from the original negative point to
the midpoint.  If the test value is negative, we continue with the
interval from the midpoint to the positive point.  Finally, there is
the possibility that the test value is 0, in which case the midpoint is
itself the root we are searching for.
</p>

<p>
To test whether the endpoints are "close enough" we can use a
procedure similar to the one used in section *Note 1-1-7:: for
computing square roots:(1)
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">close-enough?</span> x y)
  (&lt; (abs (- x y)) 0.001))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
`Search' is awkward to use directly, because we can accidentally
give it points at which f's values do not have the required sign, in
which case we get a wrong answer.  Instead we will use `search' via the
following procedure, which checks to see which of the endpoints has a
negative function value and which has a positive value, and calls the
`search' procedure accordingly.  If the function has the same sign on
the two given points, the half-interval method cannot be used, in which
case the procedure signals an error.(2)

Finding fixed points of functions
</p>
<hr />

<p>
A number x is called a "fixed point" of a function f if x satisfies the
equation f(x) = x.  For some functions f we can locate a fixed point by
beginning with an initial guess and applying f repeatedly,
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org687b28c">
f(x), f(f(x), (f(f(f(x))))
</pre>

<p>
until the value does not change very much.  Using this idea, we can
devise a procedure `fixed-point' that takes as inputs a function and an
initial guess and produces an approximation to a fixed point of the
function.  We apply the function repeatedly until we find two
successive values whose difference is less than some prescribed
tolerance:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">tolerance</span> 0.00001)

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fixed-point</span> f first-guess)
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">close-enough?</span> v1 v2)
    (&lt; (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">try</span> guess)
    (<span class="org-keyword">let</span> ((next (f guess)))
      (<span class="org-keyword">if</span> (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For example, we can use this method to approximate the fixed point
of the cosine function, starting with 1 as an initial approximation:(3)
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org564d387">
(fixed-point cos 1.0)
.7390822985224023
</pre>

<p>
Similarly, we can find a solution to the equation y = `sin' y +
`cos' y:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org73ffaec">
(fixed-point (lambda (y) (+ (sin y) (cos y)))
             1.0)
1.2587315962971173
</pre>

<p>
The fixed-point process is reminiscent of the process we used for
finding square roots in section *Note 1-1-7::.  Both are based on the
idea of repeatedly improving a guess until the result satisfies some
criterion.  In fact, we can readily formulate the square-root
computation as a fixed-point search.  Computing the square root of some
number x requires finding a y such that y<sup>2</sup> = x.  Putting this equation
into the equivalent form y = x/y, we recognize that we are looking for
a fixed point of the function(4) y |-&gt; x/y, and we can therefore try to
compute square roots as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (fixed-point (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (/ x y))
               1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Unfortunately, this fixed-point search does not converge.  Consider
an initial guess y<sub>1</sub>.  The next guess is y<sub>2</sub> = x/y<sub>1</sub> and the next guess
is y<sub>3</sub> = x/y<sub>2</sub> = x/(x/y<sub>1</sub>) = y<sub>1</sub>.  This results in an infinite loop in
which the two guesses y<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>2</sub> repeat over and over, oscillating
about the answer.
</p>

<p>
One way to control such oscillations is to prevent the guesses from
changing so much.  Since the answer is always between our guess y and
x/y, we can make a new guess that is not as far from y as x/y by
averaging y with x/y, so that the next guess after y is (1/2)(y + x/y)
instead of x/y.  The process of making such a sequence of guesses is
simply the process of looking for a fixed point of y |-&gt; (1/2)(y + x/y):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (fixed-point (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (average y (/ x y)))
               1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
(Note that <code>y = (1/2)(y + x/y)</code> is a simple transformation of the
equation y = x/y; to derive it, add y to both sides of the equation and
divide by 2.)
</p>

<p>
With this modification, the square-root procedure works.  In fact,
if we unravel the definitions, we can see that the sequence of
approximations to the square root generated here is precisely the same
as the one generated by our original square-root procedure of section
*Note 1-1-7::.  This approach of averaging successive approximations to
a solution, a technique we that we call "average damping", often aids
the convergence of fixed-point searches.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.35:</b> Show that the golden ratio [phi] (section *Note
1-2-2::) is a fixed point of the transformation x |-&gt; 1 + 1/x, and
use this fact to compute [phi] by means of the `fixed-point'
procedure.
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.36:</b> Modify `fixed-point' so that it prints the
sequence of approximations it generates, using the `newline' and
`display' primitives shown in *Note Exercise 1-22::.  Then find a
solution to x<sup>x</sup> = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x |-&gt;
`log'(1000)/`log'(x).  (Use Scheme's primitive `log' procedure,
which computes natural logarithms.)  Compare the number of steps
this takes with and without average damping.  (Note that you
cannot start `fixed-point' with a guess of 1, as this would cause
division by `log'(1) = 0.)
</p>

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.37:</b>
a. An infinite "continued fraction" is an expression of the form
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org2310cb6">
           N_1
f = ---------------------
               N_2
    D_1 + ---------------
                   N_3
          D_2 + ---------
                D_3 + ...
</pre>

<p>
As an example, one can show that the infinite continued
fraction expansion with the n<sub>i</sub> and the D<sub>i</sub> all equal to 1
produces 1/[phi], where [phi] is the golden ratio (described
in section *Note 1-2-2::).  One way to approximate an
infinite continued fraction is to truncate the expansion
after a given number of terms.  Such a truncation&#x2013;a
so-called finite continued fraction "k-term finite continued
fraction"&#x2013;has the form
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org0726899">
       N_1

<p>
Suppose that `n' and `d' are procedures of one argument (the
term index i) that return the n<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>i</sub> of the terms of the
continued fraction.  Define a procedure `cont-frac' such that
evaluating `(cont-frac n d k)' computes the value of the
k-term finite continued fraction.  Check your procedure by
approximating 1/[phi] using

<p>
for successive values of `k'.  How large must you make `k' in
order to get an approximation that is accurate to 4 decimal
places?
</p>

<b>Exercise 1.38:</b> In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
published a memoir `De Fractionibus Continuis', which included a
continued fraction expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of the
natural logarithms.  In this fraction, the n<sub>i</sub> are all 1, and the
D<sub>i</sub> are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, &#x2026;.  Write

<p>
where x is in radians.  Define a procedure `(tan-cf x k)' that

(1) We have used 0.001 as a representative "small" number to
indicate a tolerance for the acceptable error in a calculation.  The
appropriate tolerance for a real calculation depends upon the problem
to be solved and the limitations of the computer and the algorithm.
This is often a very subtle consideration, requiring help from a
numerical analyst or some other kind of magician.

<div id="outline-container-org9e5d724" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9e5d724"><span class="section-number-3">3.4.</span> Procedures as Returned Values</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<hr />

<p>
The above examples demonstrate how the ability to pass procedures as
arguments significantly enhances the expressive power of our
programming language.  We can achieve even more expressive power by
creating procedures whose returned values are themselves procedures.
</p>

<p>
We can illustrate this idea by looking again at the fixed-point
example described at the end of section *Note 1-3-3::.  We formulated a
new version of the square-root procedure as a fixed-point search,
starting with the observation that [sqrt]x is a fixed-point of the
function y |-&gt; x/y.  Then we used average damping to make the
approximations converge.  Average damping is a useful general technique
in itself.  Namely, given a function f, we consider the function whose
value at x is equal to the average of x and f(x).
</p>

<p>
We can express the idea of average damping by means of the following
procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">average-damp</span> f)
  (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x) (average x (f x))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
`Average-damp' is a procedure that takes as its argument a procedure
`f' and returns as its value a procedure (produced by the `lambda')
that, when applied to a number `x', produces the average of `x' and `(f
x)'.  For example, applying `average-damp' to the `square' procedure
produces a procedure whose value at some number x is the average of x
and x<sup>2</sup>.  Applying this resulting procedure to 10 returns the average
of 10 and 100, or 55:(1)
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org23790e5">
((average-damp square) 10)
55
</pre>

<p>
Using `average-damp', we can reformulate the square-root procedure as
follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (fixed-point (average-damp (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (/ x y)))
               1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice how this formulation makes explicit the three ideas in the
method: fixed-point search, average damping, and the function y |-&gt; x/y.
It is instructive to compare this formulation of the square-root method
with the original version given in section *Note 1-1-7::.  Bear in mind
that these procedures express the same process, and notice how much
clearer the idea becomes when we express the process in terms of these
abstractions.  In general, there are many ways to formulate a process
as a procedure.  Experienced programmers know how to choose procedural
formulations that are particularly perspicuous, and where useful
elements of the process are exposed as separate entities that can be
reused in other applications.  As a simple example of reuse, notice
that the cube root of x is a fixed point of the function y |-&gt; x/y<sup>2</sup>,
so we can immediately generalize our square-root procedure to one that
extracts cube roots:(2)

<p>
Newton's method
</p>
<hr />

<p>
When we first introduced the square-root procedure, in section *Note
1-1-7::, we mentioned that this was a special case of "Newton's
method".  If x |-&gt; g(x) is a differentiable function, then a solution
of the equation g(x) = 0 is a fixed point of the function x |-&gt; f(x)
where
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org54bbd19">
           g(x)
f(x) = x - -----
           Dg(x)
</pre>

<p>
and Dg(x) is the derivative of g evaluated at x.  Newton's method is
the use of the fixed-point method we saw above to approximate a
solution of the equation by finding a fixed point of the function f.(3)
</p>

<p>
For many functions g and for sufficiently good initial guesses for x,
Newton's method converges very rapidly to a solution of g(x) = 0.(4)
</p>

<p>
In order to implement Newton's method as a procedure, we must first
express the idea of derivative.  Note that "derivative," like average
damping, is something that transforms a function into another function.
For instance, the derivative of the function x |-&gt; x<sup>3</sup> is the function
x |-&gt; 3x<sup>2</sup>.  In general, if g is a function and dx is a small number,
then the derivative Dg of g is the function whose value at any number x
is given (in the limit of small dx) by
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgdb9e8df">
        g(x + dx) - g(x)
Dg(c) = ----------------
               dx
</pre>

<p>
Thus, we can express the idea of derivative (taking dx to be, say,
0.00001) as the procedure
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">deriv</span> g)
  (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x)
    (/ (- (g (+ x dx)) (g x))
       dx)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
along with the definition
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> <span class="org-function-name">dx</span> 0.00001)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Like `average-damp', `deriv' is a procedure that takes a procedure as
argument and returns a procedure as value.  For example, to approximate
the derivative of x |-&gt; x<sup>3</sup> at 5 (whose exact value is 75) we can
evaluate
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org83877ac">
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

((deriv cube) 5)
75.00014999664018
</pre>

<p>
With the aid of `deriv', we can express Newton's method as a
fixed-point process:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">newton-transform</span> g)
  (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (x)
    (- x (/ (g x) ((deriv g) x)))))

(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">newtons-method</span> g guess)
  (fixed-point (newton-transform g) guess))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The `newton-transform' procedure expresses the formula at the
beginning of this section, and `newtons-method' is readily defined in
terms of this.  It takes as arguments a procedure that computes the
function for which we want to find a zero, together with an initial
guess.  For instance, to find the square root of x, we can use Newton's
method to find a zero of the function y |-&gt; y<sup>2</sup> - x starting with an
initial guess of 1.(5)
</p>

<p>
This provides yet another form of the square-root procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (newtons-method (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (- (square y) x))
                  1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Abstractions and first-class procedures
</p>
<hr />

<p>
We've seen two ways to express the square-root computation as an
instance of a more general method, once as a fixed-point search and
once using Newton's method.  Since Newton's method was itself expressed
as a fixed-point process, we actually saw two ways to compute square
roots as fixed points.  Each method begins with a function and finds a
fixed point of some transformation of the function.  We can express
this general idea itself as a procedure:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">fixed-point-of-transform</span> g transform guess)
  (fixed-point (transform g) guess))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This very general procedure takes as its arguments a procedure `g'
that computes some function, a procedure that transforms `g', and an
initial guess.  The returned result is a fixed point of the transformed
function.
</p>

<p>
Using this abstraction, we can recast the first square-root
computation from this section (where we look for a fixed point of the
average-damped version of y |-&gt; x/y) as an instance of this general
method:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (fixed-point-of-transform (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (/ x y))
                            average-damp
                            1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Similarly, we can express the second square-root computation from
this section (an instance of Newton's method that finds a fixed point
of the Newton transform of y |-&gt; y<sup>2</sup> - x) as
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-scheme">(<span class="org-keyword">define</span> (<span class="org-function-name">sqrt</span> x)
  (fixed-point-of-transform (<span class="org-keyword">lambda</span> (y) (- (square y) x))
                            newton-transform
                            1.0))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We began section *Note 1-3:: with the observation that compound
procedures are a crucial abstraction mechanism, because they permit us
to express general methods of computing as explicit elements in our
programming language.  Now we've seen how higher-order procedures
permit us to manipulate these general methods to create further
abstractions.
</p>

<p>
As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the
underlying abstractions in our programs and to build upon them and
generalize them to create more powerful abstractions.  This is not to
say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way
possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of
abstraction appropriate to their task.  But it is important to be able
to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to
apply them in new contexts.  The significance of higher-order
procedures is that they enable us to represent these abstractions
explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be
handled just like other computational elements.
</p>

<p>
In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in
which computational elements can be manipulated.  Elements with the
fewest restrictions are said to have "first-class" status.  Some of the
"rights and privileges" of first-class elements are:(6)
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They may be named by variables.</li>

<li>They may be passed as arguments to procedures.</li>

<li>They may be returned as the results of procedures.</li>

<li>They may be included in data structures.(7)</li>
</ul>


<p>
Lisp, unlike other common programming languages, awards procedures
full first-class status.  This poses challenges for efficient
implementation, but the resulting gain in expressive power is
enormous.(8)

<b>Exercise 1.40:</b> Define a procedure `cubic' that can be used

<b>Exercise 1.42:</b> Let f and g be two one-argument functions.  The "composition"

<b>Exercise 1.43:</b> If f is a numerical function and n is a positive
integer, then we can form the nth repeated application of f, which

then the nth repeated application of f is the function x |-&gt; x + n.
If f is the operation of squaring a number, then the nth
repeated application of f is the function that raises its argument
to the 2<sup>nth</sup> power.  Write a procedure that takes as inputs a
procedure that computes f and a positive integer n and returns the
procedure that computes the nth repeated application of f.  Your
procedure should be able to be used as follows:

<p>
<b>Exercise 1.44:</b> The idea of "smoothing" a function is an
important concept in signal processing.  If f is a function and dx
is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the

f(x), and f(x + dx).  Write a procedure `smooth' that takes as
input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that
computes the smoothed f.  It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly
smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function, and so
on) to obtained the "n-fold smoothed function".  Show how to
generate the n-fold smoothed function of any given function using
`smooth' and `repeated' from *Note Exercise 1-43::.

<b>Exercise 1.45:</b> We saw in section *Note 1-3-3:: that attempting
to compute square roots by naively finding a fixed point of y |-&gt;
x/y does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average
damping.  The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed
points of the average-damped y |-&gt; x/y<sup>2</sup>.  Unfortunately, the
process does not work for fourth roots&#x2013;a single average damp is
not enough to make a fixed-point search for y |-&gt; x/y<sup>3</sup> converge.
On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average
damp of the average damp of y |-&gt; x/y<sup>3</sup>) the fixed-point search
does converge.  Do some experiments to determine how many average
damps are required to compute nth roots as a fixed-point search
based upon repeated average damping of y |-&gt; x/y<sup>(n-1)</sup>.  Use this
to implement a simple procedure for computing nth roots using
`fixed-point', `average-damp', and the `repeated' procedure of
*Note Exercise 1-43::.  Assume that any arithmetic operations you
need are available as primitives.

<b>Exercise 1.46:</b> Several of the numerical methods described in
this chapter are instances of an extremely general computational
strategy known as "iterative improvement".  Iterative improvement
says that, to compute something, we start with an initial guess
for the answer, test if the guess is good enough, and otherwise
improve the guess and continue the process using the improved
guess as the new guess.  Write a procedure `iterative-improve'
that takes two procedures as arguments: a method for telling
whether a guess is good enough and a method for improving a guess.
`Iterative-improve' should return as its value a procedure that
takes a guess as argument and keeps improving the guess until it
is good enough.  Rewrite the `sqrt' procedure of section *Note
1-1-7:: and the `fixed-point' procedure of section *Note 1-3-3::
in terms of `iterative-improve'.

(1) Observe that this is a combination whose operator is itself a
combination.  *Note Exercise 1-4:: already demonstrated the ability to
form such combinations, but that was only a toy example.  Here we begin
to see the real need for such combinations&#x2013;when applying a procedure
that is obtained as the value returned by a higher-order procedure.

(2) See *Note Exercise 1-45:: for a further generalization.

(3) Elementary calculus books usually describe Newton's method in
terms of the sequence of approximations x<sub>(n+1)</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> - g(x<sub>n</sub>)/Dg(x<sub>n</sub>).
Having language for talking about processes and using the idea of
fixed points simplifies the description of the method.
</p>

(4) Newton's method does not always converge to an answer, but it can
be shown that in favorable cases each iteration doubles the
number-of-digits accuracy of the approximation to the solution.  In
such cases, Newton's method will converge much more rapidly than the
half-interval method.
</p>

<p>
(5) For finding square roots, Newton's method converges rapidly to
the correct solution from any starting point.

(6) The notion of first-class status of programming-language
elements is due to the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey
(1916-1975).

<p>
(7) We'll see examples of this after we introduce data structures in
*Note Chapter 2::.
</p>

<p>
(8) The major implementation cost of first-class procedures is that
allowing procedures to be returned as values requires reserving storage
for a procedure's free variables even while the procedure is not
executing.  In the Scheme implementation we will study in section *Note
4-1::, these variables are stored in the procedure's environment.

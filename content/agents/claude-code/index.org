* Introduction

This directory contains Claude Code configuration written in literate programming style using Org-mode. Configurations include slash commands, agent skills, MCP servers, and project settings.

** What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant that extends Claude with tools for reading/writing files, running commands, and integrating with development workflows.

Key capabilities:
- File operations (read, write, edit)
- Code execution and shell commands
- Git integration
- Web search and fetching
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Extensible via slash commands and skills

** How This Works

- *Tangling*: Extract configurations to =.claude/= directory using Org-mode's babel
- *Documentation*: Each config includes detailed explanations of what it does and why
- *Modular*: Separate files for different config types for easy navigation
- *Team-Shareable*: Project configs can be version-controlled and shared

** Literate Configuration Philosophy

Following the pattern established in the [[file:../../emacs/emacs-configs.org][Emacs configurations]], these Claude Code configs use literate programming:
1. Documentation comes first - explain the "why" before the "what"
2. Code blocks use =:tangle= directives to generate actual config files
3. Examples and best practices inline with implementation
4. Easy to understand, modify, and extend

* Configuration Modules

** [[file:01-settings.org][Project Settings]]
Permissions, environment variables, model selection, hooks

Configure what tools Claude Code can use, set environment variables for your project, and control behavior through hooks.

** [[file:02-commands.org][Slash Commands]]
Custom prompt templates for repeated workflows

User-invoked commands accessed by typing =/= in Claude Code. Includes commit message generation and org-roam capture integration.

** Agent Skills

Skills that Claude automatically activates based on context. Organized by domain:

| Module                            | Description                                  |
|-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| [[file:03-skills.org][Core Skills]]             | General development patterns and practices   |
| [[file:03-skills-emacs.org][Emacs Skills]]         | Emacs integration, org-mode, LSP             |
| [[file:03-skills-javascript.org][JavaScript Skills]] | TypeScript, React, Node.js patterns          |
| [[file:03-skills-python.org][Python Skills]]       | Python, FastAPI, Django patterns             |
| [[file:03-skills-rails.org][Rails Skills]]         | Ruby on Rails development patterns           |
| [[file:03-skills-documentation.org][Documentation Skills]] | Documentation completeness checking     |

** [[file:04-mcp-servers.org][MCP Servers]]
External tool integrations via Model Context Protocol

Connect Claude Code to external services and tools. Configured for Emacs integration and project-scoped filesystem access.

** [[file:05-subagents.org][Custom Subagents]]
Specialized agents for specific tasks (future)

Placeholder for upcoming custom subagent functionality. Will be updated when the feature becomes available.

* Quick Reference

| Type          | Project Location        | User Location              | Format   |
|---------------+-------------------------+----------------------------+----------|
| Settings      | .claude/settings.json   | ~/.claude/settings.json    | JSON     |
| Commands      | .claude/commands/*.md   | ~/.claude/commands/*.md    | Markdown |
| Skills        | .claude/skills/*/       | ~/.claude/skills/*/        | Markdown |
| MCP Servers   | .mcp.json               | ~/.claude.json             | JSON     |

*Project-level* configurations are version-controlled and shared with your team. *User-level* configurations are personal preferences stored in your home directory.

* Usage

See [[file:README.org][README]] for detailed tangling instructions, editing guide, and troubleshooting.

** Quick Start

1. *Review configs*: Read through the org files to understand what each config does
2. *Customize paths*: Edit MCP server paths in =04-mcp-servers.org= if needed
3. *Tangle configs*: Run =./tangle-claude.sh= from project root
4. *Reload Claude Code*: Restart or reload to pick up new configurations

** Tangling Individual Files

From Emacs:
- Open any org file
- Run =M-x org-babel-tangle= or =C-c C-v t=

From command line:
#+begin_src bash
emacs -Q --batch \
  --eval "(require 'org)" \
  --eval "(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)" \
  --eval "(find-file \"01-settings.org\")" \
  --eval "(org-babel-tangle)" \
  --kill
#+end_src

* Project vs User Configuration

** Project-Level (Version Controlled)

Use for configurations that should be shared with your team:
- Permission policies for the project
- MCP servers everyone uses
- Common slash commands (=/review=, =/commit-msg=)
- Team-wide skills
- Project-specific settings

Files: =.claude/settings.json=, =.claude/commands/=, =.claude/skills/=, =.mcp.json=

** User-Level (Personal)

Use for personal preferences not in version control:
- Personal notification preferences
- Local development tools
- Experimental commands/skills
- API keys and credentials
- Personal MCP servers

Files: =~/.claude/settings.json=, =~/.claude/commands/=, =~/.claude/skills/=

* Integration

This configuration is part of a larger knowledge base. See [[file:../../index.org][main index]] for other configurations.

** Related Configurations

- [[file:../../neovim/configs/README.org][Neovim Configurations]] - Alternative editor setup
- [[file:../../dotfiles/index.org][Dotfiles]] - Other development tool configs

** Build Integration

These org files are automatically processed by the site's build system:
- =./build.sh= converts org files to HTML
- Generated files appear in =public/agents/claude-code/=
- Styling matches the rest of the site (GitHub Flavored Markdown theme)
- Floating table of contents for easy navigation

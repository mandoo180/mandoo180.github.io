* Welcome

This is my personal knowledge base and configuration repository, built with Org-mode and published to GitHub Pages. It contains technical notes, learning resources, and editor configurations written in literate programming style.

** What's Here

- *Editor Configurations*: Emacs and Neovim setups with detailed explanations
- *AI Agent Configs*: Claude Code slash commands, skills, and MCP integrations
- *Learning Notes*: Programming books (SICP, K&R C), tools, and documentation
- *System Setup*: Linux configuration, dotfiles, and system administration

** Features

- Literate Programming: All configurations are documented and explainable
- Floating TOC: Easy navigation with sticky table of contents
- Dark Mode: Automatic theme switching based on system preference
- Responsive: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

* Emacs

Complete Emacs configuration and learning resources using literate programming with Org-mode.

** [[file:emacs/emacs-configs.org][Emacs Configurations]]

My complete Emacs configuration written in literate programming style. The configuration is split into focused, modular files for better organization and maintainability.

*Structure*:
- 13 main configuration modules (early-init, init, theme, window, completion, etc.)
- 5 programming language modules (general, web, Python, Ruby)
- All configs include detailed inline documentation
- Tangle support to generate =~/.emacs.d/= files

*Highlights*:
- Performance optimizations and native compilation setup
- Custom mode line with clean, minimal design
- Modern completion framework (Corfu)
- LSP support for multiple languages
- Git integration with Magit

*Total*: ~4,000 lines across 18 modular files

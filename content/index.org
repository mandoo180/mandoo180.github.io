* Welcome

This is my personal knowledge base and configuration repository, built with Org-mode and published to GitHub Pages. It contains technical notes, learning resources, and my complete Emacs configuration written in literate programming style.

** What's Here

- *Emacs Configuration*: Comprehensive, modular Emacs setup with detailed explanations
- *Learning Notes*: Programming books, tools, and language documentation
- *System Setup*: Linux configuration, dotfiles, and system administration
- *Computer Science*: SICP study notes and exercises

** Features

- 📚 *Literate Programming*: All configurations are documented and explainable
- 🎨 *Floating TOC*: Easy navigation with sticky table of contents
- 🌓 *Dark Mode*: Automatic theme switching based on system preference
- 📱 *Responsive*: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

* Emacs

Complete Emacs configuration and learning resources using literate programming with Org-mode.

** [[file:emacs/emacs-configs.org][Emacs Configurations]]

My complete Emacs configuration written in literate programming style. The configuration is split into focused, modular files for better organization and maintainability.

*Structure*:
- 13 main configuration modules (early-init, init, theme, window, completion, etc.)
- 5 programming language modules (general, web, Python, Ruby)
- All configs include detailed inline documentation
- Tangle support to generate =~/.emacs.d/= files

*Highlights*:
- Performance optimizations and native compilation setup
- Custom mode line with clean, minimal design
- Modern completion framework (Corfu)
- LSP support for multiple languages
- Git integration with Magit

*Total*: ~3,800 lines across 18 modular files

* About

These configuration files are designed to be tangled using Org-mode's babel functionality. Each file contains code blocks that can be extracted to their appropriate locations in your home directory or configuration folders.

To tangle a file in Emacs:
1. Open the org file
2. Run =C-c C-v t= (or =M-x org-babel-tangle=)

This will extract the code blocks to the paths specified in the =:tangle= headers.

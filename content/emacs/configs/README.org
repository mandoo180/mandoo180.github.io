#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration Modules
#+AUTHOR: Kyeong Soo Choi
#+DATE: 2025-11-19

* Overview

This directory contains modular Emacs configuration files, split from a single large =emacs-configs.org= file for better organization and maintainability.

* File Structure

Each configuration module is a separate Org file:

| File                    | Description                                          | Tangles To                                   |

* Usage

** Tangling (Generating Configuration Files)

*** Tangle All Files

From the repository root:

#+begin_src sh
  ./tangle.sh
#+end_src

This will:
- Recursively tangle all modules in =configs/= and subdirectories
- Include files in =configs/programming/= subdirectory
- Generate all necessary =.el= files in =~/.emacs.d/=
- Skip backup files (=*.org.backup=)

*** Tangle Individual File

Open any config file in Emacs and run:

#+begin_example
M-x org-babel-tangle
#+end_example

Or use the keybinding: =C-c C-v t=

** HTML Export

The main =emacs-configs.org= file uses =#+INCLUDE= directives to bring all modules together for export.

To export to HTML:

1. Open =../emacs-configs.org= in Emacs
2. Run: =M-x org-html-export-to-html=
3. Or use the keybinding: =C-c C-e h h=

Alternatively, the whole site can be built using:

#+begin_src sh
  ./build.sh
#+end_src

* Editing

** Adding Documentation

Each module should have:

- Clear section headings (=**= or =***=)
- Explanatory text before code blocks
- Comments within code blocks for complex logic

** Adding New Configuration

1. Identify the appropriate module (or create a new one)
2. Add documentation explaining what the configuration does
3. Add the code block with appropriate =:tangle= header
4. Test by tangling and reloading Emacs

** Creating New Modules

If adding a new module:

1. Create =configs/NN-name.org= (use next number in sequence)
2. Add appropriate front matter and documentation
3. Add to =../emacs-configs.org= with =#+INCLUDE= directive
4. Update this README

* Benefits of This Structure

- *Easier Navigation*: Jump directly to the section you need
- *Faster Editing*: Smaller files load and edit faster
- *Better Documentation*: Each module can have detailed explanations
- *Selective Loading*: Can tangle only specific modules during development
- *Git-Friendly*: Smaller diffs, easier to review changes
- *Reusability*: Individual modules can be shared or reused

* Tangling Details

All modules preserve their original =:tangle= directives, so:

- They generate the same output files as the original monolithic config
- The directory structure in =~/.emacs.d/= remains unchanged
- Existing Emacs setup continues to work without modification

* Backup

The original monolithic file is backed up as:

#+begin_example
../emacs-configs.org.backup
#+end_example

* Programming Configuration Loader

This file serves as the main entry point for all programming-related configurations. It loads language-specific modules and platform-specific tools.

** Purpose

The loader (=prog-conf.el=) is responsible for:
- Loading general programming settings (=prog-general-conf=)
- Loading language-specific configurations (web, Python, Ruby)
- Conditionally loading platform-specific tools
- Managing Clojure, SQL, and tree-sitter integrations

** Architecture

The programming configuration is modular:

#+begin_example
prog-conf.el (this file)
├── prog-general-conf.el   → General programming settings
├── prog-web-conf.el       → Web development (HTML/CSS/JS/TS)
├── prog-python-conf.el    → Python development
└── prog-ruby-conf.el      → Ruby development
#+end_example

** Loader Implementation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ~/.emacs.d/elisp/settings/prog-conf.el

  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Main programming configuration file that loads language-specific modules
  ;;; and platform-specific programming tools.
  ;;; Code:

  ;; Load general programming configuration
  (require 'prog-general-conf)

  ;; Load language-specific configurations
  (require 'prog-web-conf)
  (require 'prog-python-conf)
  (require 'prog-ruby-conf)

  ;; Platform-specific and additional tools
  (unless (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
    ;; Clojure development (non-Windows only)
    ;; TODO: finish https://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/introduction/
    (use-package cider
  	:custom
  	(nrepl-use-ssh-fallback-for-remote-hosts t))

    ;; SQL database interaction
    (use-package ejc-sql
  	;; Github: https://github.com/kostafey/ejc-sql?tab=readme-ov-file#mariadbconnection
  	;; M-x ejc-connect
  	;; M-x ejc-quit-connection -> it refreshes the connection
  	:config
  	(load (expand-file-name ".local/ejc-config.el" user-emacs-directory) 'noerror 'nomessage))

    ;; Tree-sitter support
    (use-package tree-sitter
  	:config
  	(global-tree-sitter-mode 1))
    (use-package tree-sitter-langs)
    (use-package treesit-auto
  	:config
  	(global-treesit-auto-mode 1)))

  (provide 'prog-conf)
  ;;; prog-conf.el ends here

#+end_src

** Non-Windows Tools

Several tools are only loaded on non-Windows systems:

*** Clojure Development (CIDER)
- Interactive Clojure development environment
- REPL integration
- SSH support for remote development

*** SQL Database Interaction (ejc-sql)
- Connect to databases directly from Emacs
- Execute SQL queries
- Load local configuration from =~/.emacs.d/.local/ejc-config.el=

*** Tree-sitter
- Fast, incremental parsing library
- Better syntax highlighting
- More accurate code navigation
- Language grammar support via =tree-sitter-langs=
- Automatic mode activation via =treesit-auto=

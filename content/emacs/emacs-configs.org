* Introduction

This is my comprehensive Emacs configuration written in a literate programming style using Org-mode. The configuration is split into modular sections for better organization and maintainability.

** How This Works

- *Tangling*: Use =C-c C-v t= (=org-babel-tangle=) to extract all Emacs Lisp code blocks into the appropriate files in =~/.emacs.d/=
- *Exporting*: Use =C-c C-e h h= to export this document to HTML for publishing
- *Modular Structure*: Each section is in a separate file under =configs/= for easier navigation and editing

** Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Open this file in Emacs
3. Run =M-x org-babel-tangle= to generate all configuration files
4. Restart Emacs

** File Structure

The configuration is organized as follows:

- *Early Init* - Performance optimizations that must load before anything else
- *Init* - Core Emacs settings and built-in packages
- *Theme* - Visual appearance and mode line configuration
- *Window* - Window management and layout
- *Completion* - Completion frameworks and interfaces
- *Dired* - Directory editor enhancements
- *Note* - Note-taking and knowledge management
- *Shell* - Terminal and shell integration
- *Programming* - Language-specific configurations
- *Miscellaneous* - Utilities and helper functions
- *Platform-Specific* - OS-specific configurations
